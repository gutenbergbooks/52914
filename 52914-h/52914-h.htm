<p>In the volume before us we have the first two books of what was to be
Nietzsche's greatest theoretical and philosophical prose work. The
reception given to <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> had been so unsatisfactory,
and misunderstandings relative to its teaching had become so general,
that, within a year of the publication of the first part of that
famous philosophical poem, Nietzsche was already beginning to see
the necessity of bringing his doctrines before the public in a more
definite and unmistakable form. During the years that followed&mdash;that is
to say, between 1883 and 1886&mdash;this plan was matured, and although we
have no warrant, save his sister's own word and the internal evidence
at our disposal, for classing <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> (published 1886)
among the contributions to Nietzsche's grand and final philosophical
scheme, "The Will to Power," it is now impossible to separate it
entirely from his chief work as we would naturally separate <i>The Birth
of Tragedy,</i> the <i>Thoughts out of Season,</i> the volumes entitled <i>Human,
all-too-Human, The Dawn of Day,</i> and <i>Joyful Wisdom.</i></p>

<p><i>Beyond Good and Evil,</i> then, together with its sequel, <i>The Genealogy
of Morals,</i> and the two little volumes, <i>The Twilight of the Idols</i>
and the <i>Antichrist</i> (published in 1889 and 1894 respectively), must
be regarded as forming part of the general plan of which <i>The Will to
Power</i> was to be the <i>opus magnum.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately, <i>The Will to Power</i> was never completed by its author.
The text from which this translation was made is a posthumous
publication, and it suffers from all the disadvantages that a book
must suffer from which has been arranged and ordered by foster hands.
When those who were responsible for its publication undertook the task
of preparing it for the press, it was very little more than a vast
collection of notes and rough drafts, set down by Nietzsche from time
to time, as the material for his chief work; and, as any liberty taken
with the original manuscript, save that of putting it in order, would
probably have resulted in adding or excluding what the author would
on no account have added or excluded himself, it follows that in some
few cases the paragraphs are no more than hasty memoranda of passing
thoughts, which Nietzsche must have had the intention of elaborating
at some future time. In these cases the translation follows the German
as closely as possible, and the free use even of a conjunction has in
certain cases been avoided, for fear lest the meaning might be in the
slightest degree modified. It were well, therefore, if the reader could
bear these facts in mind whenever he is struck by a certain clumsiness,
either of expression or disposition, in the course of reading this
translation.</p>

<p>It may be said that, from the day when Nietzsche first recognised the
necessity of making a more unequivocal appeal to his public than
the <i>Zarathustra</i> had been, that is to say, from the spring of 1883,
his work in respect of <i>The Will to Power</i> suffered no interruption
whatsoever, and that it was his chief preoccupation from that period
until his breakdown in 1889.</p>

<p>That this span of six years was none too long for the task he had
undertaken, will be gathered from the fact that, in the great work he
had planned, he actually set out to show that the life-principle, "Will
to Power," was the prime motor of all living organisms.</p>

<p>To do this he appeals both to the animal world and to human society,
with its subdivisions, religion, art, morality, politics, etc. etc.,
and in each of these he seeks to demonstrate the activity of the
principle which he held to be the essential factor of all existence.</p>

<p>Frau Foerster-Nietzsche tells us that the notion that "The Will to
Power" was the fundamental principle of all life, first occurred to her
brother in the year 1870, at the seat of war, while he was serving as
a volunteer in a German army ambulance. On one occasion, at the close
of a very heavy day with the wounded, he happened to enter a small
town which lay on one of the chief military roads. He was wandering
through it in a leisurely fashion when, suddenly, as he turned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">[Pg i]</a></span>corner of a street that was protected on either side by lofty stone
walls, he heard a roaring noise, as of thunder, which seemed to come
from the immediate neighbourhood. He hurried forward a step or two, and
what should he see, but a magnificent cavalry regiment&mdash;gloriously
expressive of the courage and exuberant strength of a people&mdash;ride
past him like a luminous stormcloud. The thundering din waxed louder
and louder, and lo and behold! his own beloved regiment of field
artillery dashed forward at full speed, out of the mist of motes, and
sped westward amid an uproar of clattering chains and galloping steeds.
A minute or two elapsed, and then a column of infantry appeared,
advancing at the double&mdash;the men's eyes were aflame, their feet struck
the hard road like mighty hammer-strokes, and their accoutrements
glistened through the haze. While this procession passed before him,
on its way to war and perhaps to death,&mdash;so wonderful in its vital
strength and formidable courage, and so perfectly symbolic of a race
that <i>will</i> conquer and prevail, or perish in the attempt,&mdash;Nietzsche
was struck with the thought that the highest will to live could not
find its expression in a miserable "struggle for existence," but in
a will to war, a Will to Power, a will to overpower! This is said to
be the history of his first conception of that principle which is at
the root of all his philosophy, and twelve years later, in <i>Thus Spake
Zarathustra,</i> we find him expounding it thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even
in the will of the servant found I the will to be master.</p>

<p>"Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to
Life, but&mdash;so teach I thee&mdash;Will to Power!</p>

<p>"Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of
the very reckoning speaketh&mdash;the Will to Power!"</p>

<p>And three years later still, in <i>Beyond Good and Evil,</i> we read the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
being. A living thing seeks above all to <i>discharge</i> its strength&mdash;life
itself is <i>Will to Power</i>; self-preservation is only one of the
indirect and most frequent results thereof."</p>

<p>But in this volume, and the one that is to follow, we shall find
Nietzsche more mature, more sober, and perhaps more profound than
in the works above mentioned. All the loves and hates by which we
know him, we shall come across again in this work; but here he seems
to stand more above them than he had done heretofore; having once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
enunciated his ideals vehemently and emphatically, he now discusses
them with a certain grim humour, with more thoroughness and detail, and
he gives even his enemies a quiet and respectful hearing. His tolerant
attitude to Christianity on pages 8-9, 107, 323, for instance, is
a case in point, and his definite description of what we are to
understand by his pity (p. 293) leaves us in no doubt as to the calm
determination of this work. Book One will not seem so well arranged
or so well worked out as Book Two; the former being more sketchy and
more speculative than the latter. Be this as it may, it contains deeply
interesting things, inasmuch as it attempts to trace the elements of
Nihilism&mdash;as the outcome of Christian values&mdash;in all the institutions
of the present day.</p>

<p>In the Second Book Herbert Spencer comes in for a number of telling
blows, and not the least of these is to be found on page 237, where,
although his name is not mentioned, it is obviously implied. Here
Nietzsche definitely disclaims all ideas of an individualistic
morality, and carefully states that <i>his</i> philosophy aims at <i>a new
order of rank.</i></p>

<p>It will seem to some that morality is dealt with somewhat cavalierly
throughout the two books; but, in this respect, it should not be
forgotten that Nietzsche not only made a firm stand in favour of
exceptional men, but that he also believed that any morality is nothing
more than a mere system of valuations which are determined by the
conditions in which a given species lives. Hence his words on page 107:
"Beyond Good and Evil,&mdash;certainly; but we insist upon the unconditional
and strict preservation of herd-morality"; and on page 323: "Suppose
the <i>strong</i> were masters in all respects, even in valuing: let us try
and think what their attitude would be towards illness, suffering,
and sacrifice! <i>Self-contempt on the part of the weak</i> would be the
result: they would do their utmost to disappear and to extirpate their
kind. And would this be <i>desirable</i>?&mdash;should we really like a world
in which the subtlety, the consideration, the intellectuality, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
<i>plasticity</i>&mdash;in fact, the whole influence of the weak&mdash;was lacking?"</p>

<p>It is obvious from this passage that Nietzsche only objected to the
influence of herd-morality outside the herd&mdash;that is to say, among
exceptional and higher men who may be wrecked by it. Whereas most other
philosophers before him had been the "Altruist" of the lower strata of
humanity, Nietzsche may aptly be called the Altruist of the exceptions,
of the particular lucky cases among men. For such "varieties," he
thought, the morality of Christianity had done all it could do, and
though he in no way wished to underrate the value it had sometimes
been to them in the past, he saw that at present, in any case, it
might prove a great danger. With Goethe, therefore, he believed that
"Hypotheses are only the pieces of scaffolding which are erected round
a building during the course of its construction, and which are taken
away as soon as the edifice is completed. To the workman, they are
indispensable; but he must be careful not to confound the scaffolding
with the building."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is deeply to be deplored that Nietzsche was never able to complete
his life-work. The fragments of it collected in volumes i. and ii. of
<i>The Will to Power</i> are sufficiently remarkable to convey some idea of
what the whole work would have been if only its author had been able to
arrange and complete it according to his original design.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that we are too sensible nowadays to allow our
sensibilities to be shocked by serious and well-meditated criticism,
even of the most cherished among our institutions, and an honest and
sincere reformer ought no longer to find us prejudiced&mdash;to the extent
of deafness&mdash;against him, more particularly when he comes forward with
a gospel&mdash;"The Will to Power"&mdash;which is, above all, a test of our power
to will.</p>

<p>Concerning great things one should either be silent or one should speak
loftily:&mdash;loftily&mdash;that is to say, cynically and innocently.</p>


<p class="parnum">2.</p>

<p>What I am now going to relate is the history of the next two centuries.
I shall describe what will happen, what must necessarily happen:
<i>the triumph of Nihilism.</i> This history can be written already; for
necessity itself is at work in bringing it about. This future is
already proclaimed by a hundred different omens; as a destiny it
announces its advent everywhere, for this music of to-morrow all ears
are already pricked. The whole of our culture in Europe has long
been writhing in an agony of suspense which increases from decade
to decade as if in expectation of a catastrophe: restless, violent,
helter-skelter, like a torrent that will <i>reach its bourne,</i> and
refuses to reflect&mdash;yea, that even dreads reflection.</p>


<p class="parnum">3.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the present writer has done little else, hitherto,
than <i>reflect and meditate,</i> like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> an instinctive philosopher and
anchorite, who found his advantage in isolation&mdash;in remaining outside,
in patience, procrastination, and lagging behind; like a weighing and
testing spirit who has already lost his way in every labyrinth of
the future; like a prophetic bird-spirit that <i>looks backwards</i> when
it would announce what is to come; like the first perfect European
Nihilist, who, however, has already outlived Nihilism in his own
soul&mdash;who has out-grown, overcome, and dismissed it.</p>


<p class="parnum">4.</p>

<p>For the reader must not misunderstand the meaning of the title which
has been given to this Evangel of the Future. "<i>The Will to Power:
An Attempted Transvaluation of all Values</i>"&mdash;with this formula a
<i>counter-movement</i> finds expression, in regard to both a principle and
a mission; a movement which in some remote future will supersede this
perfect Nihilism; but which nevertheless regards it as a <i>necessary
step,</i> both logically and psychologically, towards its own advent,
and which positively cannot come, except <i>on top of</i> and <i>out of</i> it.
For, why is the triumph of Nihilism <i>inevitable</i> now? Because the
very values current amongst us to-day will arrive at their logical
conclusion in Nihilism,&mdash;because Nihilism is the only possible outcome
of our greatest values and ideals,&mdash;because we must first experience
Nihilism before we can realise what the actual worth of these "values"
was.... Sooner or later we shall be in need of <i>new values.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><a name="I" id="I">I.</a></h4>


<h4>A PLAN.</h4>


<p>1. Nihilism is at our door: whence comes this most gruesome of all
guests to us?&mdash;To begin with, it is a mistake to point to "social
evils," "physiological degeneration," or even to corruption as a cause
of Nihilism. This is the most straightforward and most sympathetic age
that ever was. Evil, whether spiritual, physical, or intellectual, is,
in itself, quite unable to introduce Nihilism, <i>i.e.,</i> the absolute
repudiation of worth, purpose, desirability. These evils allow of yet
other and quite different explanations. But there is one <i>very definite
explanation</i> of the phenomena: Nihilism harbours in the heart of
Christian morals.</p>


<p>2. The downfall of Christianity,&mdash;through its morality (which is
insuperable), which finally turns against the Christian God Himself
(the sense of truth, highly developed through Christianity, ultimately
revolts against the falsehood and fictitiousness of all Christian
interpretations of the world and its history. The recoil-stroke of
"God <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>is Truth" in the fanatical Belief, is: "All is false." Buddhism
of <i>action</i>....).</p>


<p>3. Doubt in morality is the decisive factor. The downfall of the
<i>moral</i> interpretation of the universe, which loses its <i>raison
d'être</i> once it has tried to take flight to a Beyond, meets its
end in Nihilism. "Nothing has any purpose" (the inconsistency of
one explanation of the world, to which men have devoted untold
energy,&mdash;gives rise to the suspicion that all explanations may perhaps
be false). The Buddhistic feature: a yearning for nonentity (Indian
Buddhism has no fundamentally moral development at the back of it; that
is why Nihilism in its case means only morality not overcome; existence
is regarded as a punishment and conceived as an error; error is thus
held to be punishment&mdash;a moral valuation). Philosophical attempts to
overcome the "moral God" (Hegel, <i>Pantheism</i>). The vanquishing of
popular ideals: the wizard, the saint, the bard. Antagonism of "true"
and "beautiful" and "good."</p>


<p>4. Against "purposelessness" on the one hand, against moral valuations
on the other: how far has all science and philosophy been cultivated
heretofore under the influence of moral judgments? And have we not got
the additional factor&mdash;the enmity of science, into the bargain? Or the
prejudice against science? Criticism of Spinoza. Christian valuations
everywhere present as remnants in socialistic and positivistic systems.

<p>5. The Nihilistic consequences of present natural <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>science (along

finally <i>arises</i> a certain self-annihilation, an antagonistic attitude
towards itself&mdash;a sort of anti-scientificality. Since Copernicus man
has been rolling away from the centre towards <i>x</i>.</p>


<p>6. The Nihilistic consequences of the political and politico-economical
way of thinking, where all principles at length become tainted with the
atmosphere of the platform: the breath of mediocrity, insignificance,
dishonesty, etc. Nationalism. Anarchy, etc. Punishment. Everywhere
the <i>deliverer</i> is missing, either as a class or as a single man&mdash;the
justifier.</p>


<p>7. Nihilistic consequences of history and of the "practical historian,"
<i>i.e.,</i> the romanticist. The attitude of art is quite unoriginal in
modern life. Its gloominess. Goethe's so-called Olympian State.</p>

Existence Which Have Prevailed Heretofore.</p>



<p class="parnum">2.</p>

<p>What does Nihilism mean?&mdash;<i>That the highest values are losing their
value.</i> There is no bourne. There is no answer to the question: "to
what purpose?"</p>


<p class="parnum">3.</p>

<p>Thorough Nihilism is the conviction that life is absurd, in the
light of the highest values already discovered; it also includes the
<i>view</i> that we have not the smallest right to assume the existence of
transcendental objects or things in themselves, which would be either
divine or morality incarnate.</p>

<p>This view is a result of fully developed "truthfulness": therefore a
consequence of the belief in morality.</p>


<p class="parnum">4.</p>

<p>What <i>advantages</i> did the Christian hypothesis of morality offer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>(1) It bestowed an intrinsic value upon men, which contrasted with
their apparent insignificance and subordination to chance in the
eternal flux of becoming and perishing.</p>

<p>(2) It served the purpose of God's advocates, inasmuch as it granted
the world a certain <i>perfection</i> despite its sorrow and evil&mdash;it also
granted the world that proverbial "freedom": evil seemed full of
<i>meaning</i>.</p>

<p>(3) It assumed that man could have a <i>knowledge</i> of absolute values,
and thus granted him <i>adequate perception</i> for the most important
things.</p>

<p>(4) It prevented man from despising himself as man, from turning
against life, and from being driven to despair by knowledge: it was a
self-preservative measure.</p>



<p>In short: Morality was the great <i>antidote</i> against practical and
theoretical Nihilism.</p>


<p class="parnum">5.</p>

<p>But among the forces reared by morality, there was <i>truthfulness</i>:
this in the end turns against morality, exposes the <i>teleology</i> of the
latter, its interestedness, and now the <i>recognition</i> of this lie so
long incorporated, from which we despaired of ever freeing ourselves,
acts just like a stimulus. We perceive certain needs in ourselves,
implanted during the long dynasty of the moral interpretation of life,
which now seem to us to be needs of untruth: on the other hand, those
very needs represent the highest values owing to which we are able to
endure life. We have <i>ceased</i> from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>attaching any worth to what we
know, and we <i>dare</i> not attach any more worth to that with which we
would fain deceive ourselves&mdash;from this antagonism there results a
process of dissolution.</p>


<p class="parnum">6.</p>

<p>This is the <i>antinomy</i>: In so far as we believe in morality, we condemn
existence.</p>


<p class="parnum">7.</p>

<p>The highest values in the service of which man ought to live, more

<i>social values, owing to their tone-strengthening</i> tendencies,
were built over men's heads as though they were the will of God or
"reality," or the actual world, or even a hope of a world to come.
Now that the lowly origin of these values has become known, the
whole universe seems to have been transvalued and to have lost its
significance&mdash;but this is only an intermediate stage.</p>


<p class="parnum">8.</p>

<p>The consequence of <i>Nihilism</i> (disbelief in all values) as a result
of a moral valuation:&mdash;<i>We have grown to dislike egotism</i> (even

grown to dislike what is most necessary</i> (although we have recognised

have set our values&mdash;at the same time those other spheres in which we
live have <i>not</i> thereby gained <i>one iota</i> in value. On the contrary, we
are <i>tired,</i> because we have lost the main incentive to live. "All in

<p class="title">The Collapse of Cosmopolitan Values.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A.</i></p>

<p>Nihilism will have to manifest itself as a <i>psychological condition,
first</i> when we have sought in all that has happened a purpose which
is not there: so that the seeker will ultimately lose courage.
Nihilism is therefore the coming into consciousness of the long
<i>waste</i> of strength, the pain of "futility," uncertainty, the lack
of an opportunity to recover in some way, or to attain to a state of
peace concerning anything&mdash;shame in one's own presence, as if one
had <i>cheated</i> oneself too long.... The purpose above-mentioned might
have been achieved: in the form of a "realisation" of a most high
canon of morality in all worldly phenomena, the moral order of the
universe; or in the form of the increase of love and harmony in the
traffic of humanity; or in the nearer approach to a general condition
of happiness; or even in the march towards general nonentity&mdash;any sort
of goal always constitutes a purpose. The common factor to all these
appearances is that something will be <i>attained,</i> through the process
itself: and now we perceive that Becoming has been aiming at <i>nothing,</i>
and has achieved nothing. Hence the disillusionment in regard to a
so-called <i>purpose in existence,</i> as a cause of Nihilism; whether this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>be in respect of a very definite purpose, or generalised into the
recognition that all the hypotheses are false which have hitherto been
offered as to the object of life, and which relate to the whole of
"Evolution" (man <i>no longer</i> an assistant in, let alone the culmination
of, the evolutionary process).</p>

<p>Nihilism will manifest itself as a psychological condition, in the
second place, when man has fixed a totality, a systematisation, even an
organisation in and behind all phenomena, so that the soul thirsting
for respect and admiration will wallow in the general idea of a highest
ruling and administrative power (if it be the soul of a logician,
the sequence of consequences and perfect reasoning will suffice to
conciliate everything). A kind of unity, some form of "monism":'
and as a result of this belief man becomes obsessed by a feeling of
profound relativity and dependence in the presence of an All which
is infinitely superior to him, a sort of divinity. "The general good
exacts the surrender of the individual ..." but lo, there is no such
general good! At bottom, man loses the belief in his own worth when no
infinitely precious entity manifests itself through him&mdash;that is to
say, he conceived such an All, <i>in order to be able to believe in his
own worth.</i></p>

<p>Nihilism, as a psychological condition, has yet a third and last form.
Admitting these two <i>points of view</i>: that no purpose can be assigned
to Becoming, and that no great entity rules behind all Becoming, in
which the individual may completely lose himself as in an element of
superior value; there still remains the <i>subterfuge</i> which would
consist <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>in condemning this whole world of Becoming as an illusion,
and in discovering a world which would lie beyond it, and would be a
<i>real</i> world. The moment, however, that man perceives that this world
has been devised only for the purpose of meeting certain psychological
needs, and that he has no right whatsoever to it, the final form of
Nihilism comes into being, which comprises <i>a denial of a metaphysical
world,</i> and which forbids itself all belief in a <i>real</i> world. From
this standpoint, the reality of Becoming is the only reality that
is admitted: all bypaths to back-worlds and false godheads are
abandoned&mdash;but <i>this world is no longer endured, although no one wishes
to disown it.</i></p>

<p>What has actually happened? The feeling of worthlessness was realised
when it was understood that neither the notion of "<i>Purpose</i>" nor
that of "<i>Unity</i>" nor that of "<i>Truth</i>" could be made to interpret
the general character of existence. Nothing is achieved or obtained
thereby; the unity which intervenes in the multiplicity of events is
entirely lacking: the character of existence is not "true," it is
<i>false</i>; there is certainly no longer any reason to believe in a <i>real</i>
world. In short, the categories, "Purpose," "Unity," "Being," by means
of which we had lent some worth to life, we have once more divorced
from it&mdash;and the world now appears <i>worthless</i> to us....</p>

<p class="center"><i>B.</i></p>

<p>Admitting that we have recognised the impossibility of <i>interpreting</i>
world by means of these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>three categories, and that from this
standpoint the world begins to be worthless to us; we must ask
ourselves whence we derived our belief in these three categories.
Let us see if it is possible to refuse to believe in them. If we can
<i>deprive them of their value,</i> the proof that they cannot be applied to
the world, is no longer a sufficient reason for <i>depriving that world
of its value</i>.</p>

<p>Result: <i>The belief</i> in the categories of reason<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is the cause
of Nihilism&mdash;we have measured the worth of the world according to
categories <i>which can only be applied to a purely fictitious world.</i></p>

<p>Conclusion: All values with which we have tried, hitherto, to lend
the world some worth, from our point of view, and with which we have
therefore <i>deprived it of all worth</i> (once these values have been
shown to be inapplicable)&mdash;all these values, are, psychologically,
the results of certain views of utility, established for the purpose
of maintaining and increasing the dominion of certain communities:
but falsely projected into the nature of things. It is always man's
<i>exaggerated ingenuousness</i> to regard himself as the sense and measure
of all things.</p>

<p class="parnum">13.</p>

<p>Nihilism represents an intermediary pathological condition (the vast
generalisation, the conclusion that there <i>is no purpose</i> in anything,
is pathological): <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>whether it be that the productive forces are not
yet strong enough&mdash;or that <i>decadence</i> still hesitates and has not yet
discovered its expedients.</p>

<p><i>The conditions of this hypothesis</i>:&mdash;That there is <i>no truth</i>; that
there is no absolute state of affairs&mdash;no "thing-in-itself." <i>This
alone is Nihilism, and of the most extreme kind.</i> It finds that the
value of things consists precisely in the fact that these values are
<i>not</i> real and never have been real, but that they are only a symptom
of strength on the part of the <i>valuer,</i> a simplification serving the
<i>purposes of existence.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">14.</p>

<p><i>Values and their modification</i> are related to the <i>growth of power of
the valuer.</i></p>

<p>The measure of <i>disbelief</i> and of the "freedom of spirit" which is
tolerated, viewed as an <i>expression of the growth of power.</i></p>

<p>"Nihilism" viewed as the ideal of the <i>highest spiritual power,</i> of the
over-rich life, partly destructive, partly ironical.</p>


<p class="parnum">15.</p>

<p>What is <i>belief</i>? How is a belief born? All belief assumes that
<i>something is true.</i></p>

<p>The extremest form of Nihilism would mean that <i>all</i> belief&mdash;all
assumption of truth&mdash;is false: because no real world is at hand.
It were therefore: only an <i>appearance seen in perspective,</i> whose
origin must be found in us (seeing that we are constantly in need of a
narrower, a shortened, and simplified world).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>This should be realised, that the extent to which we can, in our heart
of hearts, acknowledge appearance, and the necessity of falsehood,
without going to rack and ruin, is the <i>measure of strength.</i></p>

<p>In this respect, Nihilism, in that it is the <i>negation</i> of a real world
and of Being, might be <i>a divine view of the world.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">16.</p>

<p>If we are disillusioned, we have not become so in regard to life,
but owing to the fact that our eyes have been opened to all kinds
of "desiderata." With mocking anger we survey that which is called
"<i>Ideal</i>": we despise ourselves only because we are unable at every
moment of our lives to quell that absurd emotion which is called
"Idealism." This <i>pampering</i> by means of ideals is stronger than the
anger of the <i>disillusioned one.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">17.</p>

<p><i>To what extent does Schopenhauerian Nihilism continue to be the result
of the same ideal as that which gave rise to Christian Theism?</i> The
amount of certainty concerning the most exalted desiderata, the highest
values and the greatest degree of perfection, was so great, that the
philosophers started out from it as if it had been an <i>a priori</i> and
<i>absolute fact</i>: "God" at the head, as the <i>given quantity</i>&mdash;Truth. "To
become like God," "to be absorbed into the Divine Being"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>these were
for centuries the most ingenuous and most convincing desiderata (but
that which convinces is not necessarily true on that account: it is
<i>nothing more nor less than convincing.</i> An observation for donkeys).</p>

<p>The granting of a <i>personal-reality</i> to this accretion of ideals
has been unlearned: people have become atheistic. But has the ideal
actually been abandoned? The latest metaphysicians, as a matter of
fact, still seek their true "reality" in it&mdash;the "thing-in-itself"
beside which everything else is merely appearance. Their dogma is, that
because our world of appearance is so obviously <i>not</i> the expression
of that ideal, it therefore cannot be "true"&mdash;and at bottom does not
even lead back to that metaphysical world as cause. The unconditioned,
in so far as it stands for that highest degree of perfection, cannot
possibly be the reason of all the conditioned. Schopenhauer, who
desired it otherwise, was obliged to imagine this metaphysical basis as
the antithesis to the ideal, as "an evil, blind will": thus it could
be "that which appears," that which manifests itself in the world of
appearance. But even so, he did not give up that ideal absolute&mdash;he
circumvented it....</p>

<p>(Kant seems to have needed the hypothesis of "intelligible freedom,"<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
in order to relieve the <i>ens perfectum</i> of the responsibility of having
contrived this world as it is, in short, in order to explain evil:
scandalous logic for a philosopher!).</p>

<p><i>The most general sign of modern times</i>: in his own estimation, man has
lost an infinite amount of <i>dignity.</i> For a long time he was the centre
and tragic hero of life in general; then he endeavoured to demonstrate
at least his relationship to the most essential and in itself most
valuable side of life&mdash;as all metaphysicians do, who wish to hold fast
to the <i>dignity of man,</i> in their belief that moral values are cardinal
values. He who has let God go, clings all the more strongly to the
belief in morality.</p>


<p class="parnum">19.</p>

<p>Every purely <i>moral</i> valuation (as, for instance, the Buddhistic)
<i>terminates in Nihilism</i>: Europe must expect the same thing! It is
supposed that one can get along with a morality bereft of a religious
background; but in this direction the road to Nihilism is opened. There
is nothing in religion which compels us to regard ourselves as valuing
creatures.</p>


<p class="parnum">20.</p>

<p>The question which Nihilism puts, namely, "to what purpose?" is the
outcome of a habit, hitherto, to regard the purpose as something fixed,
given and exacted <i>from outside</i>&mdash;that is to say, by some supernatural
authority. Once the belief in this has been unlearned, the force of an
old habit leads to the search after <i>another</i> authority, which would
<i>know how to speak unconditionally,</i> and could <i>point to</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>goals and
missions. The authority of the <i>conscience</i> now takes the first place
(the more <i>morality</i> is emancipated from theology, the more imperative
does it become) as a compensation for the <i>personal authority.</i> Or
the authority of <i>reason.</i> Or the <i>gregarious instinct</i> (the herd).
Or history with its <i>immanent</i> spirit, which has its goal in itself,
and to which one can <i>abandon oneself.</i> One would like to <i>evade</i> the
<i>will,</i> as also the <i>willing</i> of a goal and the risk of setting oneself
a goal. One would like to get rid of the responsibility (<i>Fatalism</i>
would be accepted). Finally: Happiness and with a dash of humbug, the
<i>happiness of the greatest number.</i></p>

<p>It is said:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A definite goal is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>(2) Such a goal cannot possibly be foreseen. Precisely now, when <i>will</i>
in its <i>fullest strength</i> were <i>necessary,</i> it is in the <i>weakest</i>
and most <i>pusillanimous</i> condition. <i>Absolute mistrust concerning the
organising power</i> of the will.</p>


<p class="parnum">21.</p>

<p><i>The perfect Nihilist.</i>&mdash;The Nihilist's eye <i>idealises in an ugly
sense,</i> and is inconstant to what it remembers: it allows its
recollections to go astray and to fade, it does not protect them from
that cadaverous coloration with which weakness dyes all that is distant
and past. And what it does not do for itself it fails to do for the
whole of mankind as well&mdash;that is to say, it allows it to drop.</p>

<p>Nihilism. It may be <i>two things</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Nihilism as a sign of <i>enhanced spiritual strength</i>: active Nihilism.</p>

<p>B. Nihilism as a sign of the <i>collapse</i> and <i>decline</i> of spiritual
<i>strength</i>: passive Nihilism.</p>


<p class="parnum">23.</p>

<p>Nihilism, a <i>normal</i> condition.</p>

<p>It may be a sign of <i>strength</i>; spiritual vigour may have increased to
such an extent that the <i>goals</i> toward which man has marched <i>hitherto</i>
(the "convictions," articles of faith) are no longer suited to it
(for a faith generally expresses the exigencies of the <i>conditions of
existence,</i> a submission to the authority of an order of things which
<i>conduces</i> to the <i>prosperity,</i> the <i>growth</i> and <i>power</i> of a living
creature ...); on the other hand, a sign of <i>insufficient</i> strength, to
fix a goal, a "wherefore," and a faith for itself.</p>

<p>It reaches its <i>maximum</i> of relative strength, as a powerful
<i>destructive</i> force, in the form of <i>active Nihilism.</i></p>

<p>Its opposite would be <i>weary</i> Nihilism, which no longer attacks: its
most renowned form being Buddhism: as <i>passive</i> Nihilism, a sign of
weakness: spiritual strength may be fatigued, <i>exhausted,</i> so that the
goals and values which have prevailed <i>hitherto</i> are no longer suited
to it and are no longer believed in&mdash;so that the synthesis of values
and goals (upon which every strong culture stands) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>decomposes, and
the different values contend with one another: <i>Disintegration,</i> then
everything which is relieving, which heals, becalms, or stupefies,
steps into the foreground under the cover of various <i>disguises,</i>
either religious, moral, political or æsthetic, etc.</p>


<p class="parnum">24.</p>

<p>Nihilism is not only a meditating over the "in vain!"&mdash;not only the
belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts
one's shoulder to the plough; <i>one destroys.</i> This, if you will, is
illogical; but the Nihilist does not believe in the necessity of being
logical.... It is the condition of strong minds and wills; and to these
it is impossible to be satisfied with the negation of judgment: the
<i>negation by deeds</i> proceeds from their nature. Annihilation by the
reasoning faculty seconds annihilation by the hand.</p>


<p class="parnum">25.</p>

<p><i>Concerning the genesis of the Nihilist.</i> The courage of all one really
<i>knows</i> comes but late in life. It is only quite recently that I have
acknowledged to myself that heretofore I have been a Nihilist from top
to toe. The energy and thoroughness with which I marched forward as a
Nihilist deceived me concerning this fundamental principle. When one is
progressing towards a goal it seems impossible that "aimlessness <i>per
se</i>" should be one's fundamental article of faith.</p>

<p><i>The Pessimism of strong natures.</i> The "wherefore" after a terrible
struggle, even after victory. That something may exist which is a
hundred times <i>more important</i> than the question, whether we feel well
or unwell, is the fundamental instinct of all strong natures&mdash;and
consequently too, whether the <i>others</i> feel well or unwell. In short,
that we have a purpose, for which we would not even hesitate to
<i>sacrifice men,</i> run all risks, and bend our backs to the worst: <i>this

<p class="title">2. Further Causes of Nihilism.</p>


<p class="parnum">27.</p>

<p><i>The causes of Nihilism</i>: (1) <i>The higher species is lacking, i.e.,</i>
the species whose inexhaustible fruitfulness and power would uphold our
belief in Man (think only of what is owed to Napoleon&mdash;almost all the
higher hopes of this century).</p>

<p>(2) <i>The inferior species</i> ("herd," "ass," "society") is forgetting
modesty, and inflates its needs into <i>cosmic</i> and <i>metaphysical</i>
values. In this way all life is <i>vulgarised</i>: for inasmuch as the
<i>mass</i> of mankind rules, it tyrannises over the <i>exceptions,</i> so that
these lose their belief in themselves and become <i>Nihilists.</i></p>

<p>All attempts to <i>conceive of a new species</i> come to nothing

<p><i>The varieties of self-stupefaction.</i> In one's heart of hearts, not to

means of emotional intoxication: emotional intoxication in the form of
music, in the form of cruelty in the tragic joy over the ruin of the
noblest, and in the form of blind, gushing enthusiasm over individual
<i>men</i> or distinct <i>periods</i> (in the form of hatred, etc.). The attempt
to work blindly, like a scientific instrument; to keep an eye on the
many small joys, like an investigator, for instance (modesty towards
oneself); the mysticism of the voluptuous <i>joy</i> of eternal emptiness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>art "for art's sake" ("le fait"), "immaculate investigation," in the
form of narcotics against the disgust of oneself; any kind of incessant
work, <i>any</i> kind of small foolish fanaticism; the medley of all
means, illness as the result of general profligacy (dissipation kills
pleasure).</p>

<p>(1) As a result, feeble will-power.</p>

<p>(2) Excessive pride and the humiliation of petty weakness felt as a

<p>The time is coming when we shall have to pay for having been
<i>Christians</i> for two thousand years: we are losing the equilibrium
which enables us to live&mdash;for a long while we shall not know in what
direction we are travelling. We are hurling ourselves headlong into the
<i>opposite</i> valuations, with that degree of energy which could only have
been engendered in man by an <i>overvaluation</i> of himself.</p>

<p>Now, everything is false from the root, words and nothing but words,
confused, feeble, or over-strained.</p>

<p><i>(a)</i> There is a seeking after a sort of earthly solution of the
problem of life, but in the same sense as that of the <i>final triumph</i>
of truth, love, justice (socialism: "equality of persons").</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> There is also an attempt to hold fast to the <i>moral ideal</i> (with
altruism, self-sacrifice, and the denial of the will, in the front
rank).</p>

<p><i>(c)</i> There is even an attempt to hold fast to a "Beyond": were it
only as an antilogical <i>x</i>; but it is forthwith interpreted in such a
way that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a kind of metaphysical solace, after the old style, may be
derived from it.</p>

<p><i>(d)</i> There is an attempt to read the phenomena of life in such a
way as to arrive <i>at the divine guidance of old,</i> with its powers
of rewarding, punishing, educating, and of generally conducing to a
something <i>better</i> in the order of things.</p>

<p><i>(e)</i> People once more believe in good and evil; so that the victory of
the good and the annihilation of the evil is regarded as a <i>duty</i> (this
is English, and is typical of that blockhead, John Stuart Mill).</p>

<p>(f) The contempt felt for "naturalness," for the desires and for the
ego: the attempt to regard even the highest intellectuality of art as a
result of an impersonal and disinterested attitude.</p>

<p>(g) The Church is still allowed to meddle in all the essential
occurrences and incidents in the life of the individual, with a view to
consecrating it and giving it a <i>loftier</i> meaning: we still have the
"Christian State" and the "Christian marriage."</p>

<p>There have been more thoughtful and more destructively thoughtful<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
times than ours: times like those in which Buddha appeared, for
instance, in which the people themselves, after centuries of sectarian
quarrels, had sunk so deeply into the abyss of philosophical dogmas,
as, from time to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>time, European people have done in regard to the fine
points of religious dogma. "Literature" and the press would be the last
things to seduce one to any high opinion of the spirit of our times:
the millions of Spiritists, and a Christianity with gymnastic exercises
of that ghastly ugliness which is characteristic of all English
inventions, throw more light on the subject.</p>

<p>European <i>Pessimism</i> is still in its infancy&mdash;a fact which argues
against it: it has not yet attained to that prodigious and yearning
fixity of sight to which it attained in India once upon a time, and
in which nonentity is reflected; there is still too much of the
"ready-made," and not enough of the "evolved" in its constitution, too
much learned and poetic Pessimism; I mean that a good deal of it has
been discovered, invented, and "created," but not caused.</p>

<p>Criticism of the Pessimism which has prevailed hitherto. The want of
the eudæmonological standpoint, as a last abbreviation of the question:
what is the <i>purpose</i> of it all? The reduction of gloom.</p>

<p><i>Our</i> Pessimism: the world has not the value which we believed it to
have,&mdash;our faith itself has so increased our instinct for research that
we are <i>compelled</i> to say this to-day. In the first place, it seems of
less value: <i>at first it is felt</i> to be of less value,&mdash;only in this
sense are we pessimists,&mdash;that is to say, with the will to acknowledge
this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>transvaluation without reserve, and no longer, as heretofore, to
deceive ourselves and chant the old old story.</p>

<p>It is precisely in this way that we find the pathos which urges us to
seek for <i>new values.</i> In short: the world might have far more value
than we thought&mdash;we must get behind the <i>naïveté of our ideals,</i> for
it is possible that, in our conscious effort to give it the highest
interpretation, we have not bestowed even a moderately just value upon
it.</p>

<p>What has been <i>deified</i>? The valuing instinct inside the <i>community</i>
(that which enabled it to survive).</p>

<p>What has been <i>calumniated</i>? That which has tended to separate higher
men from their inferiors, the instincts which cleave gulfs and build
barriers.</p>


<p class="parnum">33.</p>

<p>Causes effecting the <i>rise of Pessimism</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The most powerful instincts and those which promised most for the
future have hitherto been <i>calumniated,</i> so that life has a curse upon
it.</p>

<p>(2) The growing bravery and the more daring mistrust on the part of man
have led him to discover the fact that <i>these instincts cannot be
cut adrift from life,</i> and thus he turns to embrace life.</p>

<p>(3) Only the most <i>mediocre,</i> who are not <i>conscious</i> of this conflict,
prosper; the higher species fail, and as an example of degeneration
tend to dispose all hearts against them&mdash;on the other hand, there is
some indignation caused by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>the mediocre positing themselves as the end
and meaning of all things. No one can any longer reply to the question:
"Why?"</p>

<p>(4) Belittlement, susceptibility to pain, unrest, haste, and confusion
are steadily increasing&mdash;the materialisation of all these tendencies,
which is called "civilisation," becomes every day more simple, with
the result that, in the face of the monstrous machine, the individual
<i>despairs</i> and <i>surrenders.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">34.</p>

<p>Modern Pessimism is an expression of the uselessness only of the
<i>modern</i> world, not of the world and existence as such.</p>


<p class="parnum">35.</p>

<p>The "preponderance of <i>pain over pleasure"</i> or the reverse (Hedonism);
both of these doctrines are already signposts to Nihilism....</p>

<p>For here, in both cases, no other final purpose is sought than the
phenomenon pleasure or pain.</p>

<p>But only a man who no longer dares to posit a will, a purpose, and a
final goal can speak in this way&mdash;according to every healthy type of
man, the worth of life is certainly not measured by the standard of
these secondary things. And a <i>preponderance</i> of pain would be possible
and, <i>in spite of it,</i> a mighty will, a <i>saying of yea</i> to life, and a
holding of this preponderance for necessary.</p>

<p>"Life is not worth living"; "Resignation"; "what is the good of
tears?"&mdash;this is a feeble and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>sentimental attitude of mind. "<i>Un
monstre gai vaut mieux qu'un sentimental ennuyeux.</i>"</p>


<p class="parnum">36.</p>

<p>The philosophie Nihilist is convinced that all phenomena are without
sense and are in vain, and that there ought to be no such thing as
Being without sense and in vain. But whence comes this "There ought
not to be?"&mdash;whence this "sense" and <i>this standard</i>? At bottom the
Nihilist supposes that the sight of such a desolate, useless Being is
<i>unsatisfying</i> to the philosopher, and fills him with desolation and
despair. This aspect of the case is opposed to our subtle sensibilities
as a philosopher. It leads to the absurd conclusion that the character
of existence <i>must perforce afford pleasure to the philosopher</i> if it
is to have any right to subsist.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to understand that happiness and unhappiness, within
the phenomena of this world, can only serve the purpose of <i>means</i>:
the question yet remaining to be answered is, whether it <i>will
ever be possible</i> for us to perceive the "object" and "purpose" of
life&mdash;whether the problem of purposelessness or the reverse is not
quite beyond our ken.</p>


<p class="parnum">37.</p>

<p>The development of <i>Nihilism out of Pessimism.</i> The denaturalisation
of <i>Values.</i> Scholasticism of values. The values isolated, idealistic,
instead <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>of ruling and leading action, turn <i>against</i> it and condemn it.</p>

<p>Opposites introduced in the place of natural gradations and ranks.
Hatred of the order of rank. Opposites are compatible with a plebeian
age, because they are more easy to grasp.</p>

<p>The <i>rejected</i> world is opposed to an artificially constructed "true
and valuable" one. At last we discover out of what material the "true"
world was built; all that remains, now, is the rejected world, and to
the account of our reasons for <i>rejecting it we place our greatest
disillusionment.</i></p>

<p>At this point <i>Nihilism</i> is reached; the directing values have been
retained&mdash;nothing more!</p>

<p>This gives rise to <i>the problem of strength and weakness</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The weak fall to pieces upon it;</p>

<p>(2) The strong destroy what does not fall to pieces of its own accord;</p>

<p class="title">3. The Nihilistic Movement As an Expression of Decadence.</p>


<p class="parnum">38.</p>

<p>Just lately an accidental and in every way inappropriate term has been
very much misused: everywhere people are speaking of "<i>Pessimism</i>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and there is a fight around the question (to which some replies must be
forthcoming): which is right&mdash;Pessimism or Optimism?</p>

<p>People have not yet seen what is so terribly-obvious&mdash;namely, that
Pessimism is not a problem but a <i>symptom,</i>&mdash;that the term ought to be
replaced by "Nihilism,"&mdash;that the question, "to be or not to be," is
itself an illness, a sign of degeneracy, an idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>The Nihilistic movement is only an expression of physiological
decadence.</p>


<p class="parnum">39.</p>

<p><i>To be understood</i>:&mdash;That every kind of decline and tendency to
sickness has incessantly been at work in helping to create general
evaluations: that in those valuations which now dominate, decadence
has even begun to preponderate, that we have not only to combat the
conditions which present misery and degeneration have brought into
being; but that all decadence, previous to that of our own times, has
been transmitted and has therefore remained an <i>active force</i> amongst
us. A universal departure of this kind, on the part of man, from
his fundamental instincts, such universal decadence of the valuing
judgment, is the note of interrogation <i>par excellence,</i> the real
riddle, which the animal "man" sets to all philosophers.</p>


<p class="parnum">40.</p>

<p><i>The notion "decadence":&mdash;Decay, decline,</i> and <i>waste,</i> are, <i>per se,</i>
in no way open to objection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>they are the natural consequences of life
and vital growth. The phenomenon of decadence is just as necessary to
life as advance or progress is: we are not in a position which enables
us to <i>suppress</i> it. On the contrary, reason <i>would have it retain its
rights.</i></p>

<p>It is disgraceful on the part of socialist-theorists to argue that
circumstances and social combinations could be devised which would put
an end to all vice, illness, crime, prostitution, and poverty.... But
that is tantamount to condemning <i>Life</i> ... a society is not at liberty
to remain young. And even in its prime it must bring forth ordure and
decaying matter. The more energetically and daringly it advances, the
richer will it be in failures and in deformities, and the nearer it
will be to its fall. Age is not deferred by means of institutions. Nor
is illness. Nor is vice.</p>


<p class="parnum">41.</p>

<p>Fundamental aspect of the nature of decadence: <i>what has heretofore
been regarded as its causes are its effects.</i></p>

<p>In this way, the whole perspective <i>of the problems of morality</i> is
altered.</p>

<p>All the struggle of morals against vice, luxury, crime, and even
against illness, seems a <i>naïveté,</i> a superfluous effort: there is no
such thing as "<i>improvement</i>" (a word against <i>repentance</i>).</p>

<p>Decadence itself is not a thing <i>that can be withstood</i>: it is
absolutely necessary and is proper to all ages and all peoples. That
which must be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>withstood, and by all means in our power, is the
spreading of the contagion among the sound parts of the organism.</p>

<p>Is that done? The very <i>reverse</i> is done. It is precisely on this
account that one makes a stand on behalf of <i>humanity.</i></p>

<p>How do the <i>highest values</i> created hitherto stand in relation to this
fundamental question in <i>biology</i>? Philosophy, religion, morality, art,
etc.</p>

<p>(The remedy: militarism, for instance, from Napoleon onwards, who
regarded civilisation as his natural enemy.)</p>


<p class="parnum">42.</p>

<p>All those things which heretofore have been regarded as the <i>causes of
degeneration,</i> are really its effects.</p>

<p>But those things also which have been regarded as the <i>remedies</i> of
degeneration are only <i>palliatives</i> of certain effects thereof: the
"cured" are <i>types of the degenerate.</i></p>

<p><i>The results of decadence</i>: vice&mdash;viciousness; illness&mdash;sickliness;
crime&mdash;criminality; celibacy&mdash;sterility; hysteria&mdash;the weakness of the
will; alcoholism; pessimism, anarchy; debauchery (also of the spirit).
The calumniators, underminers, sceptics, and destroyers.</p>


<p class="parnum">43.</p>

<p>Concerning the notion "decadence." (1) Scepticism is a result of
decadence: just as spiritual debauchery is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
(2) Moral corruption is a result of decadence (the weakness of the will
and the need of strong stimulants).</p>

<p>(3) Remedies, whether psychological or moral, do not alter the march
of decadence, they do not arrest anything; physiologically they do not
count.</p>

<p>A peep into the <i>enormous futility</i> of these pretentious "reactions";
they are forms of anæsthetising oneself against certain fatal
symptoms resulting from the prevailing condition of things; they do
not eradicate the morbid element; they are often heroic attempts to
cancel the decadent man, to allow only a minimum of his <i>deleterious
influence</i> to survive.</p>

<p>(4) Nihilism is not a cause, but only the <i>rationale</i> of decadence.</p>

<p>(5) The "good" and the "bad" are no more than two types of decadence:
they come together in all its fundamental phenomena.</p>

<p>(6) The <i>social problem</i> is a result of <i>decadence.</i></p>

<p>(7) Illnesses, more particularly those attacking the nerves and the
head, are signs that the <i>defensive</i> strength of strong nature is
lacking; a proof of this is that irritability which causes pleasure and
pain to be regarded as problems of the first order.</p>


<p class="parnum">44.</p>

<p><i>The most common types of decadence</i>: (1) In the belief that they are
remedies, cures are chosen which only precipitate exhaustion;&mdash;this is
the case with Christianity (to point to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>most egregious example of
mistaken instinct);&mdash;this is also the case with "progress."</p>

<p>(2) The <i>power of resisting</i> stimuli is on the wane&mdash;chance rules
supreme: events are inflated and drawn out until they appear monstrous
... a suppression of the "personality," a disintegration of the
will; in this regard we may mention a whole class of morality, the
altruistic, that which is incessantly preaching pity, and whose most
essential feature is the weakness of the personality, so that it <i>rings
in unison,</i> and, like an over-sensitive string, does not cease from
vibrating ... extreme irritability....</p>

<p>(3) Cause and effect are confounded: decadence is not understood as
physiological, and its results are taken to be the causes of the
general indisposition:&mdash;this applies to all religious morality.</p>

<p>(4) A state of affairs is desired in which suffering shall cease;
life is actually considered the cause of all ills&mdash;<i>unconscious</i> and
insensitive states (sleep and syncope) are held in incomparably higher
esteem than the conscious states; hence a <i>method</i> of life.</p>


<p class="parnum">45.</p>

<p>Concerning the hygiene of the "weak." All that is done in weakness ends
in failure. Moral: do nothing. The worst of it is, that precisely the
strength required in order to stop action, and to cease from reacting,
is most seriously diseased under the influence of weakness: that one
never <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>reacts more promptly or more blindly than when one should not
react at all.</p>

<p>The strength of a character is shown by the ability to delay and
postpone reaction: a certain ἀδιαφορία is just as proper to it, as
involuntariness in recoiling, suddenness and lack of restraint in
"action," are proper to weakness. The will is weak: and the recipe
for preventing foolish acts would be: to have a strong will and to do
nothing&mdash;contradiction. A sort of self-destruction, the instinct of
self-preservation is compromised.... <i>The weak man injures himself</i>....
That is the decadent <i>type</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we meet with a vast amount of thought concerning
the means wherewith <i>impassibility</i> may be induced. To this extent, the
instincts are on the right scent; for to do nothing is more useful than
to do something....</p>

<p>All the practices of private orders, of solitary philosophers, and of
fakirs, are suggested by a correct consideration of the fact, that a
certain kind of man is most <i>useful to himself</i> when he hinders his own
action as much as possible.</p>

<p><i>Relieving measures</i>: absolute obedience, mechanical activity, total
isolation from men and things that might exact immediate decisions and
actions.</p>


<p class="parnum">46.</p>

<p><i>Weakness of Will</i>: this is a fable that can lead astray. For there
is no will, consequently neither a strong nor a weak one. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
multiplicity and disintegration of the instincts, the want of system in
their relationship, constitute what is known as a "weak will"; their
co-ordination, under the government of one individual among them,
results in a "strong will"&mdash;in the first case vacillation and a lack
of equilibrium is noticeable: in the second, precision and definite
direction.</p>


<p class="parnum">47.</p>

<p>That which is inherited is not illness, but a <i>predisposition to
illness</i>: a lack of the powers of resistance against injurious external
influences, etc. etc, broken powers of resistance; expressed morally:
resignation and humility in the presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether it would not be possible to class all the
highest values of the philosophies, moralities, and religions which
have been devised hitherto, with the values of the feeble, the <i>insane</i>
and the <i>neurasthenic</i> in a milder form, they present the same evils.</p>

<p>The value of all morbid conditions consists in the fact that they
magnify certain normal phenomena which are difficult to discern in
normal conditions....</p>

<p><i>Health</i> and <i>illness</i> are not essentially different, as the ancient
doctors believed and as a few practitioners still believe to-day. They
cannot be imagined as two distinct principles or entities which fight
for the living organism and make it their battlefield. That is nonsense
and mere idle gossip, which no longer holds water. As a matter of
fact, there is only a difference of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>degree between these two living
conditions: exaggeration, want of proportion, want of harmony among the
normal phenomena, constitute the morbid state (Claude Bernard).</p>

<p>Just as "evil" may be regarded as exaggeration, discord, and want of
proportion, so can "good" be regarded as a sort of protective diet
against the danger of exaggeration, discord, and want of proportion.</p>

<p><i>Hereditary weakness</i> as a <i>dominant</i> feeling: the cause of the
prevailing values.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Weakness is in demand&mdash;why?... mostly because people cannot be
anything else than weak.</p>

<p><i>Weakening considered a duty</i>: The weakening of the desires, of the
feelings of pleasure and of pain, of the will to power, of the will
to pride, to property and to more property; weakening in the form of
humility; weakening in the form of a belief; weakening in the form
of repugnance and shame in the presence of all that is natural&mdash;in
the form of a denial of life, in the form of illness and chronic
feebleness; weakening in the form of a refusal to take revenge, to
offer resistance, to become an enemy, and to show anger.</p>

<p><i>Blunders</i> in the treatment: there is no attempt at combating weakness
by means of any fortifying system; but by a sort of justification
consisting of moralising; <i>i.e.,</i> by means of <i>interpretation.</i></p>

<p>Two totally different conditions are <i>confused</i>: for instance, the
<i>repose of strength,</i> which is essentially abstinence from reaction
(the prototype of the gods whom nothing moves), and the <i>peace of
exhaustion,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> rigidity to the point of anæsthesia. All these philosophic
and ascetic modes of procedure aspire to the second state, but actually
pretend to attain to the first ... for they ascribe to the condition
they have reached the attributes that would be in keeping only with a
divine state.</p>


<p class="parnum">48.</p>

<p><i>The most dangerous misunderstanding.</i>&mdash;There is one concept which
apparently allows of no confusion or ambiguity, and that is the concept
<i>exhaustion.</i> Exhaustion may be acquired or inherited&mdash;in any case it
alters the aspect and <i>value of things.</i></p>

<p>Unlike him who involuntarily <i>gives</i> of the superabundance which he
both feels and represents, to the things about him, and who sees them
fuller, mightier, and more pregnant with promises,&mdash;who, in fact, <i>can</i>
bestow,&mdash;the exhausted one belittles and disfigures everything he
sees&mdash;he impoverishes its worth: he is detrimental....</p>

<p>No mistake seems possible in this matter: and yet history discloses the
terrible fact, that the exhausted have always been <i>confounded</i> with
those with the most abundant resources, and the latter with the most
detrimental.</p>

<p>The pauper in vitality, the feeble one, impoverishes even life: the
wealthy man, in vital powers, enriches it. The first is the parasite of
the second: the second is a bestower of his abundance. How is confusion
possible?</p>

<p>When he who was exhausted came forth with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>the bearing of a very
active and energetic man (when degeneration implied a certain excess
of spiritual and nervous discharge), he was <i>mistaken</i> for the wealthy
man. He inspired terror. The cult of the madman is also always the cult
of him who is rich in vitality, and who is a powerful man. The fanatic,
the one possessed, the religious epileptic, all eccentric creatures
have been regarded as the highest types of power: as divine.</p>

<p>This kind of strength which inspires terror seemed to be, above all,
divine: this was the starting-point of authority; here <i>wisdom</i>
was interpreted, hearkened to, and sought. Out of this there was
developed, everywhere almost, a <i>will</i> to "deify," <i>i.e.,</i> to a typical
degeneration of spirit, body, and nerves: an attempt to discover the
road to this higher form of being. To make oneself ill or mad, to
provoke the symptoms of serious disorder&mdash;was called getting stronger,
becoming more superhuman, more terrible and more wise. People thought
they would thus attain to such wealth of power, that they would be able
to <i>dispense</i> it. Wheresoever there have been prayers, some one has
been sought who had something to give away.</p>

<p>What led astray, here, was the experience of intoxication. This
increases the feeling of power to the highest degree, therefore, to the

<p><i>Acquired,</i> not inherited exhaustion: (1) inadequate <i>nourishment,</i>
often the result of ignorance concerning diet, as, for instance, in the
case of scholars; (2) erotic precocity: the damnation more especially
of the youth of France&mdash;Parisian youths, above all, who are already
dirtied and ruined when they step out of their <i>lycées</i> into the world,
and who cannot break the chains of despicable tendencies; ironical and
scornful towards themselves&mdash;galley-slaves despite all their refinement
(moreover, in the majority of cases, already a symptom of racial and
family decadence, as all hypersensitiveness is; and examples of the
infection of environment: to be influenced by one's environment is
also a sign of decadence); (3) alcoholism, not the instinct but the
habit, foolish imitation, the cowardly or vain adaptation to a ruling
fashion. What a blessing a Jew is among Germans! See the obtuseness,
the flaxen head, the blue eye, and the lack of intellect in the face,
the language, and the bearing; the lazy habit of stretching the limbs,
and the need of repose among Germans&mdash;a need which is not the result of
overwork, but of the disgusting excitation and over-excitation caused
by alcohol.</p>

is the lowest in the order of rank among societies); the "Beyond"

<p>If Nature have no pity on the degenerate, it is not therefore
immoral: the growth of physiological and moral evils in the human
race, is rather the <i>result</i> of <i>morbid and unnatural morality.</i> The
sensitiveness of the majority of men is both morbid and unnatural.</p>

<p>Why is it that mankind is corrupt in a moral and physiological respect?
The body degenerates if one organ is <i>unsound.</i> The <i>right of altruism</i>
cannot be traced to physiology, neither can the right to help and
to the equality of fate: these are all premiums for degenerates and
failures.</p>

<p>There can be no <i>solidarity</i> in a society containing unfruitful,
unproductive, and destructive members, who, by the bye, are bound to
have offspring even more degenerate than they are themselves.</p>


<p class="parnum">53.</p>

<p>Decadence exercises a profound and perfectly unconscious influence,
even over the ideals of science: all our sociology is a proof of this
proposition, and it has yet to be reproached with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>fact that
it has only the experience of <i>society in the process of decay,</i>
and inevitably takes its own decaying instincts as the basis of
sociological judgment.</p>

<p>The <i>declining</i> vitality of modern Europe formulates its social ideals
in its decaying instincts: and these ideals are all so like those of
<i>old and effete</i> races, that they might be mistaken for one another.</p>

<p>The <i>gregarious instinct,</i> then,&mdash;now a sovereign power,&mdash;is something
totally different from the instinct of an <i>aristocratic society</i>: and
the value of the sum depends upon the value of the units constituting
it.... The whole of our sociology knows no other instinct than that
of the herd, <i>i.e.,</i> of a <i>multitude of mere ciphers</i>&mdash;of which every
cipher has "equal rights," and where it is a virtue to be&mdash;&mdash;naught....</p>

<p>The valuation with which the various forms of society are judged to-day
is absolutely the same with that which assigns a higher place to peace
than to war: but this principle is contrary to the teaching of biology,
and is itself a mere outcome of decadent life. Life is a result of war,
society is a means to war.... Mr. Herbert Spencer was a decadent in
biology, as also in morality (he regarded the triumph of altruism as a
desideratum!!!).</p>

<p>After thousands of years of error and confusion, it is my good fortune
to have rediscovered the road which leads to a Yea and to a Nay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
I teach people to say Nay in the face of all that makes for weakness
and exhaustion.</p>

<p>I teach people to say Yea in the face of all that makes for strength,
that preserves strength, and justifies the feeling of strength.</p>

<p>Up to the present, neither the one nor the other has been taught; but
rather virtue, disinterestedness, pity, and even the negation of life.
All these are values proceeding from exhausted people.</p>

<p>After having pondered over the physiology of exhaustion for some time,
I was led to the question: to what extent the judgments of exhausted
people had percolated into the world of values.</p>

<p>The result at which I arrived was as startling as it could possibly
be&mdash;even for one like myself who was already at home in many a strange
world: I found that all prevailing values&mdash;that is to say, all those
which had gained ascendancy over humanity, or at least over its tamer
portions, could be traced back to the judgment of exhausted people.</p>

<p>Under the cover of the holiest names, I found the most destructive
tendencies; people had actually given the name "God" to all that
renders weak, teaches weakness, and infects with weakness.... I found
that the "good man" was a form of self-affirmation on the part of
decadence.</p>

<p>That virtue which Schopenhauer still proclaimed as superior to all,
and as the most fundamental of all virtues; even that same pity I
recognised as more dangerous than any vice. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Deliberately to thwart
the law of selection among species, and their natural means of purging
their stock of degenerate members&mdash;this, up to my time, had been the
greatest of all virtues....</p>

<p>One should do honour to the <i>fatality</i> which says to the feeble:
"perish!"</p>

<p>The opposing of this fatality, the botching of mankind and the allowing
of it to putrefy, was given the name "God" One shall not take the name
of the Lord one's God in vain....</p>

<p>The race is corrupted&mdash;not by its vices, but by its ignorance: it is
corrupted because it has not recognised exhaustion as exhaustion:
physiological misunderstandings are the cause of all evil.</p>

<p>Virtue is our greatest misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Problem: how were the exhausted able to make the laws of values? In
other words, how did they who are the last, come to power?... How did
the instincts of the animal man ever get to stand on their heads?...</p>

<p class="title">4. The Crisis: Nihilism and the Idea of Recurrence.</p>


<p class="parnum">55.</p>

<p>Extreme positions are not relieved by more moderate ones, but by
extreme <i>opposite</i> positions. And thus the belief in the utter
immorality of nature, and in the absence of all purpose and sense, are
psychologically necessary attitudes when the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>belief in God and in an
essentially moral order of things is no longer tenable.</p>

<p>Nihilism now appears, <i>not</i> because the sorrows of existence are
greater than they were formerly, but because, in a general way, people
have grown suspicious of the "meaning" which might be given to evil and
even to existence. One interpretation has been overthrown: but since it
was held to be <i>the</i> interpretation, it seems as though there were no
meaning in existence at all, as though everything were in vain.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>It yet remains to be shown that this "in vain!" is the character
of present Nihilism. The mistrust of our former valuations has
increased to such an extent that it has led to the question: "are
not all 'values' merely allurements prolonging the duration of the
comedy, without, however, bringing the unravelling any closer?" The
"long period of time" which has culminated in an "in vain," without
either goal or purpose, is the <i>most paralysing</i> of thoughts, more
particularly when one sees that one is duped without, however, being
able to resist being duped.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Let us imagine this thought in its worst form: existence, as it is,
without either a purpose or a goal, but inevitably recurring, without
an end in nonentity: "<i>Eternal Recurrence.</i>"</p>

<p>This is the extremest form of Nihilism: nothing (purposelessness)
eternal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
European form of Buddhism: the energy of knowledge and of strength
drives us to such a belief. It is the most <i>scientific</i> of all
hypotheses. We deny final purposes. If existence had a final purpose it
would have reached it.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>It should be understood that what is being aimed at, here, is a
contradiction of Pantheism: for "everything perfect, divine, eternal,"
<i>also</i> leads <i>to the belief in Eternal Recurrence.</i> Question: has this
pantheistic and affirmative attitude to all things also been made
possible by morality? At bottom only the moral God has been overcome.
Is there any sense in imagining a God "beyond good and evil"? Would
Pantheism in <i>this</i> sense be possible? Do we withdraw the idea of
purpose from the process, and affirm the process notwithstanding?
This were so if, within that process, something were <i>attained</i> every
moment&mdash;and always the same thing. Spinoza won an affirmative position
of this sort, in the sense that every moment, according to him, has
a logical necessity: and he triumphed by means of his fundamentally
logical instinct over a like conformation of the world.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>But his case is exceptional. If every <i>fundamental trait of character,</i>
which lies beneath every act, and which finds expression in every
act, were recognised by the individual as <i>his</i> fundamental <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>trait of
character, this individual would be driven to regard every moment of
his existence in general, triumphantly as good. It would simply be
necessary for that fundamental trait of character to be felt in oneself
as something good, valuable, and pleasurable.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Now, in the case of those men and classes of men who were treated
with violence and oppressed by their fellows, <i>morality</i> saved life
from despair and from the leap into nonentity:. for impotence in
relation to mankind and <i>not</i> in relation to Nature is what generates
the most desperate bitterness towards existence. Morality treated the
powerful, the violent, and the "masters" in general, as enemies against
whom the common man must be protected&mdash;<i>that is to say, emboldened,
strengthened.</i> Morality has therefore always taught the most profound
<i>hatred</i> and <i>contempt</i> of the fundamental trait of character of all
rulers&mdash;<i>i.e., their Will to Power.</i> To suppress, to deny, and to
decompose this morality, would mean to regard this most thoroughly
detested instinct with the reverse of the old feeling and valuation.
If the sufferer and the oppressed man were <i>to lose his belief</i> in his
right to contemn the Will to Power, his position would be desperate.
This would be so if the trait above-mentioned were essential to life,
in which case it would follow that even that will to morality was only
a cloak to this "Will to Power," as are also even that hatred and
contempt. The oppressed man would then <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>perceive that he stands <i>on
the same platform</i> with the oppressor, and that he has no individual
privilege, nor any <i>higher rank</i> than the latter.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>On the <i>contrary</i>! There is nothing on earth which can have any value,
if it have not a modicum of power&mdash;granted, of course, that life itself
is the Will to Power. Morality protected the <i>botched</i> and <i>bungled</i>
against Nihilism, in that it gave every one of them infinite worth,
metaphysical worth, and classed them altogether in one order which did
not correspond with that of worldly power and order of rank: it taught
submission, humility, etc. <i>Admitting that the belief in this morality
be destroyed,</i> the botched and the bungled would no longer have any
comfort, and would perish.</p>


<p>This <i>perishing</i> seems like <i>self-annihilation,</i> like an instinctive
selection of that which must be destroyed. The <i>symptoms</i> of this
self-destruction of the botched and the bungled: self-vivisection,
poisoning, intoxication, romanticism, and, above all, the instinctive
constraint to acts whereby the powerful are made into <i>mortal
enemies</i> (training, so to speak, one's own hangmen), <i>the will to
destruction</i> as the will of a still deeper instinct&mdash;of the instinct of
self-destruction, of the Will to Nonentity.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Nihilism is a sign that the botched and bungled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>in order to be
destroyed, that, having been deprived of morality, they no longer have
any reason to "resign themselves," that they take up their stand on the
territory of the opposite principle, and <i>will also exercise power</i>
themselves, by compelling the powerful to become their hangmen. This
is the European form of Buddhism, that <i>active negation,</i> after all
existence has lost its meaning.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that "poverty" has grown more acute, on the
contrary! "God, morality, resignation" were remedies in the very
deepest stages of misery: <i>active</i> Nihilism made its appearance in
circumstances which were relatively much more favourable. The fact,
alone, that morality is regarded as overcome, presupposes a certain
degree of intellectual culture; while this very culture, for its part,
bears evidence to a certain relative well-being. A certain intellectual
fatigue, brought on by the long struggle concerning philosophical
opinions, and carried to hopeless scepticism <i>against</i> philosophy,
shows moreover that the level of these Nihilists is by no means a
low one. Only think of the conditions in which Buddha appeared! The
teaching of the eternal recurrence would have learned principles to
go upon (just as Buddha's teaching, for instance, had the notion of
causality, etc.).</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>What do we mean to-day by the words "botched and bungled"? In the
first place, they are used <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><i>physiologically</i> and not politically. The
unhealthiest kind of man all over Europe (in all classes) is the soil
out of which Nihilism grows: this species of man will regard eternal
recurrence as damnation&mdash;once he is bitten by the thought, he can no
longer recoil before any action. He would not extirpate passively,
but would cause everything to be extirpated which is meaningless
and without a goal to this extent; although it is only a spasm, or
sort of blind rage in the presence of the fact that everything has
existed again and again for an eternity&mdash;even this period of Nihilism
and destruction. The value of such a <i>crisis</i> is that it <i>purifies,</i>
that it unites similar elements, and makes them mutually destructive,
that it assigns common duties to men of opposite persuasions, and
brings the weaker and more uncertain among them to the light, thus
taking the first step towards a new <i>order of rank</i> among forces
from the standpoint of health: recognising commanders as commanders,
subordinates as subordinates. Naturally irrespective of all the present
forms of society.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>What class of men will prove they are strongest in this new order of
things? The most moderate&mdash;they who do not <i>require</i> any extreme forms
of belief, they who not only admit of, but actually like, a certain
modicum of chance and nonsense; they who can think of man with a very
moderate view of his value, without becoming weak and small on that
account; the most rich in health, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>who are able to withstand a maximum
amount of sorrow, and who are therefore not so very much afraid of
sorrow&mdash;men who are <i>certain of their power,</i> and who represent with
conscious pride the state of strength to which man has attained.</p>

the age in which we were born&mdash;an age of enormous internal decay and
disintegration which, with all its weakness and even with the best of
its strength, is opposed to the spirit of youth. Disintegration&mdash;that

which calls forth a counter-stroke. Just as the sharp demarcation of

and acknowledged (in the form of "heredity"), but people will not have
anything to do with it. The extension of one will over long periods
of time, the selection of conditions and valuations which make it
possible to dispose of centuries in advance&mdash;this, precisely, is what
is most utterly anti-modern. From which it follows, that disorganising
principles give our age its specific character.</p>

<p>The means employed in former times in order to arrive at <i>similarly

The centralisation of an enormous number of, different interests in one
soul: which, <i>to that end,</i> must be very strong and mutable.</p>

<p>Why does everything become <i>mummery.</i>&mdash;The modern man is lacking in
unfailing instinct (instinct being understood here to mean that which
is the outcome of a <i>long period of activity in the same occupation</i> on
the part of one family of men); the incapability of producing anything
perfect, is simply the result of this lack of instinct: one individual
alone cannot make up for the schooling his ancestors should have
transmitted to him.</p>

<p>What a morality or book of law creates: that deep instinct which
renders <i>automatism</i> and perfection possible in life and in work.</p>

<p>But now we have reached the opposite point; yes, we wanted to reach
it&mdash;the most extreme consciousness, through introspection on the part
of man and of history: and thus we are practically most distant from
perfection in Being, doing, and willing: our desires&mdash;even our will
to knowledge&mdash;shows how prodigiously decadent we are. We are striving
after the very reverse of what <i>strong races</i> and <i>strong natures</i> will
have&mdash;understanding is an <i>end</i>....</p>

<p>That Science is possible in the way in which it is practised to-day,
proves that all elementary instincts, <i>the instincts which ward off
danger and protect life,</i> are no longer active. We no longer save, we
are merely spending the capital of our forefathers, even in the way in
which we <i>pursue knowledge</i>.</p>

(repugnance towards romantic ideals and lies). The latter, morally,
as a sense of greatest truthfulness, but pessimistic. Pure "artists"

father-confessor and puritanical psychology&mdash;two forms of psychological
romanticism: but also their counter-stroke, the attempt to maintain a

newspapers, forms, tastes, and even landscapes. The speed of this
affluence is <i>prestissimo</i>; impressions are wiped out, and people
instinctively guard against assimilating anything or against taking
anything <i>seriously</i> and "digesting" it; the result is a weakening of
the powers of digestion. There begin a sort of <i>adaptation</i> to this
accumulation of impressions. Man unlearns the art of <i>doing,</i> and

<p>A capable artisan or scholar cuts a good figure if he have his pride
in his art, and looks pleasantly and contentedly upon life. On the
other hand, there is no sight more wretched than that of a cobbler or
a schoolmaster who, with the air of a martyr, gives one to understand
that he was really <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>born for something better. There is nothing better
than what is good! and that is: to have a certain kind of capacity and
to use it. This is <i>virtù</i> in the Italian style of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Nowadays, when the state has a nonsensically oversized belly, in all
fields and branches of work there are "representatives" over and above
the real workman: for instance, in addition to the scholars, there
are the journalists; in addition to the suffering masses, there is a
crowd of jabbering and bragging ne'er-do-wells who "represent" that
suffering&mdash;not to speak of the professional politicians who, though
quite satisfied with their lot, stand up in Parliament and, with
strong lungs, "represent" grievances. Our modern life is extremely
<i>expensive,</i> thanks to the host of middlemen that infest it; whereas
in the city of antiquity, and in many a city of Spain and Italy
to-day, where there is an echo of the ancient spirit, the man himself
comes forward and will have nothing to do with a representative or an

<p>The men I have regarded with the most loathing, heretofore, are the
parasites of intellect: they are to be found everywhere, already, in
our modern Europe, and as a matter of fact their conscience is as light
as it possibly can be. They may be a little turbid, and savour somewhat
of Pessimism, but in the main they are voracious, dirty, dirtying,
stealthy, insinuating, light-fingered gentry, scabby&mdash;and as innocent
as all small sinners and microbes are. They live at the expense of
those who have intellect and who distribute it liberally: they know
that it is peculiar to the rich mind to live in a disinterested
fashion, without taking too much petty thought for the morrow, and
to distribute its wealth prodigally. For intellect is a bad domestic
economist, and pays no heed whatever to the fact that everything lives
on it and devours it.</p>

<p>"<i>Without the Christian Faith</i>" said Pascal, "you would yourselves

<p><i>Schopenhauer</i> and <i>Pascal.</i>&mdash;I none essential point, Schopenhauer is
the first who <i>takes up Pascal's</i> movement again: <i>un monstre et un
chaos,</i> consequently something that must be negatived ... history,
nature, and man himself!</p>

<p>"<i>Our inability to know the truth</i> is the result of our <i>corruption,</i>
of our moral <i>decay</i>" says Pascal. And Schopenhauer says essentially
the same. "The more profound the corruption of reason is, the
more necessary is the doctrine of salvation"&mdash;or, putting it into

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<i>Schopenhauer's</i> fundamental misunderstanding of the <i>will</i> (just
as though passion, instinct, and desire were the essential factors
of will) is typical: the depreciation of the will to the extent of
mistaking it altogether. Likewise the hatred of willing: the attempt at
seeing something superior&mdash;yea, even superiority itself, and that which
really matters, in non-willing, in the "subject-being <i>without</i> aim or
intention." Great symptom of <i>fatigue or of the weakness of will</i>: for
this, in reality, is what treats the passions as master, and directs
them as to the way and to the measure....</p>

<p>In my opinion, Henrik Ibsen has become very German. With all his
robust idealism and "Will to Truth," he never dared to ring himself
free from moral-illusionism which says "freedom," and will not admit,
even to itself, what freedom is: the second stage in the metamorphosis
of the "Will to Power" in him who lacks it. In the first stage, one
demands justice at the hands of those who have power. In the second,
one speaks of "freedom," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>that is to say, one wishes to "shake oneself
free" from those who have power. In the third stage, one speaks of
"equal rights"&mdash;that is to say, so long as one is not a predominant
personality one wishes to prevent one's competitors from growing in
power.</p>

<p>The Decline of <i>Protestantism</i>: theoretically and historically
understood as a half-measure. Undeniable predominance of Catholicism
to-day: Protestant feeling is so dead that the strongest
<i>anti-Protestant</i> movements (Wagner's <i>Parsifal,</i> for instance) are no
longer regarded as such. The whole of the more elevated intellectuality
in France is <i>Catholic</i> in instinct; Bismarck recognised that there was
no longer any such thing as Protestantism.</p>


<p class="parnum">88.</p>

<p>Protestantism, that spiritually unclean and tiresome form of decadence,
in which Christianity has known how to survive in the mediocre North,
is something incomplete and complexly valuable for knowledge, in so far
as it was able to bring experiences of different kinds and origins into
the same heads.</p>

<p>What has the German spirit not made out of Christianity! And, to refer
to Protestantism again, how much beer is there not still in Protestant
Christianity! Can a crasser, more indolent, and more lounging form
of Christian belief <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>be imagined, than that of the average German
Protestant?... It is indeed a very humble Christianity. I call it
the Homœopathy of Christianity! I am reminded that, to-day, there
also exists a less humble sort of Protestantism; it is taught by
royal chaplains and anti-Semitic speculators: but nobody has ever
maintained that any "spirit" "hovers" over these waters. It is merely
a less respectable form of Christian faith, not by any means a more
comprehensible one.</p>

<p><i>Progress.</i>&mdash;Let us be on our guard lest we deceive ourselves! Time
flies forward apace,&mdash;we would fain believe that everything flies
forward with it,&mdash;that evolution is an advancing development.... That
is the appearance of things which deceives the most circumspect. But
the nineteenth century shows no advance whatever on the sixteenth:
and the German spirit of 1888 is an example of a backward movement
when compared with that of 1788.... Mankind does not advance, it does
not even exist. The aspect of the whole is much more like that of a
huge experimenting workshop where some things in all ages succeed,
while an incalculable number of things fail; where all order, logic,
co-ordination, and responsibility is lacking. How dare we blink the
fact that the rise of Christianity is a decadent movement?&mdash;that the
German Reformation was a recrudescence of Christian barbarism?&mdash;that
the Revolution destroyed the instinct for an organisation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>of society
on a large scale?... Man is not an example of progress as compared with
animals: the tender son of culture is an abortion compared with the
Arab or the Corsican; the Chinaman is a more successful type&mdash;that is
to say, richer in sustaining power than the European.</p>

<p>Gloominess and pessimistic influence necessarily follow in the wake of
enlightenment. Towards 1770 a falling-off in cheerfulness was already
noticeable; women, with that very feminine instinct which always
defends virtue, believed that immorality was the cause of it. Galiani
hit the bull's eye: he quotes Voltaire's verse:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"Un monstre gai vaut mieux<br />
Qu'un sentimental ennuyeux."<br />
</p>

<p>If now I maintain that I am ahead, by a century or two of
enlightenment, of Voltaire and Galiani&mdash;who was much more profound, how
deeply must I have sunk into gloominess! This is also true, and betimes
I somewhat reluctantly manifested some caution in regard to the German
and Christian narrowness and inconsistency of Schopenhauerian or, worse
still, Leopardian Pessimism, and sought the most characteristic form
(Asia). But, in order to endure that extreme Pessimism (which here and
there peeps out of my <i>Birth of Tragedy),</i> to live alone "without God
or morality," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>I was compelled to invent a counter-prop for myself.
Perhaps I know best why man is the only animal that laughs: he alone
surfers so excruciatingly that he was <i>compelled</i> to invent laughter.
The unhappiest and most melancholy animal is, as might have been
expected, the most cheerful.</p>


<p class="parnum">92.</p>

<p>In regard to German culture, I have always had a feeling as of
<i>decline.</i> The fact that I learned to know a declining form of culture
has often made me <i>unfair</i> towards the whole phenomenon of European
culture. The Germans always follow at some distance behind: they always
go to the root of things, for instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dependance upon foreigners; <i>Kant</i>&mdash;Rousseau, the sensualists, Hume,
Swedenborg.</p>

<p><i>Schopenhauer</i>&mdash;the Indians and Romanticism, Voltaire.</p>

<p><i>Wagner</i>&mdash;the French cult of the ugly and of grand opera, <i>Paris,</i> and
the flight into <i>primitive barbarism</i> (the marriage of brother and
sister).</p>

<p>The law of the <i>laggard</i> (the provinces go to Paris, Germany goes to
France).</p>

<p>How is it that precisely <i>Germans discovered the Greek</i> (the more an
instinct is developed, the more it is <i>tempted</i> to run for once into
its opposite).</p>

<p>Music is the last breath of every culture.</p>


<p class="parnum">93.</p>

<p><i>Renaissance and Reformation.</i>&mdash;What does the Renaissance prove? That
the reign of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"individual" can be only a short one. The output
is too great; there is not even the possibility of husbanding or of
capitalising forces, and exhaustion sets in step by step. These are
times when everything is <i>squandered,</i> when even the strength itself
with which one collects, capitalises, and heaps riches upon riches,
<i>is squandered.</i> Even the opponents of such movements are driven to
preposterous extremes in the dissipation of their strength: and they
too are very soon exhausted, used up, and completely sapped.</p>

<p>In the Reformation we are face to face with a wild and plebeian
counterpart of the Italian Renaissance, generated by similar impulses,
except that the former, in the backward and still vulgar North, had to
assume a religious form&mdash;there the concept of a higher life had not yet
been divorced from that of a religious one.</p>

<p>Even the Reformation was a movement for individual liberty; "every one
his own priest" is really no more than a formula for <i>libertinage.</i>
As a matter of fact, the words "Evangelical freedom" would have
sufficed&mdash;and all instincts which had reasons for remaining concealed
broke out like wild hounds, the most brutal needs suddenly acquired the
courage to show themselves, everything seemed justified ... men refused
to specify the kind of freedom they had aimed at, they preferred to
shut their eyes. But the fact that their eyes were closed and that
their lips were moistened with gushing orations, did not prevent their
hands from being ready to snatch at whatever there was to snatch at,
that the belly became the god of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>"free gospel," and that all lusts
of revenge and of hatred were indulged with insatiable fury.</p>

<p>This lasted for a while: then exhaustion supervened, just as it
had done in Southern Europe; and again here, it was a low form of
exhaustion, a sort of general <i>ruere in servitium</i>.... Then the
<i>disreputable</i> century of Germany dawned.</p>


<p class="parnum">94.</p>

<p><i>Chivalry</i>&mdash;the position won by power: its gradual break-up (and
partial transference to broader and more bourgeois spheres). In the
case of Larochefoucauld we find a knowledge of the actual impulses of a
noble temperament&mdash;together with the gloomy Christian estimate of these
impulses.</p>

<p>The <i>protraction of Christianity</i> through the <i>French Revolution.</i> The
seducer is Rousseau; he once again liberates woman, who thenceforward
is always represented as ever more interesting&mdash;<i>suffering.</i> Then come
the slaves and Mrs. Beecher-Stowe. Then the poor and the workmen.
Then the vicious and the sick&mdash;all this is drawn into the foreground
(even for the purpose of disposing people in favour of the genius,
it has been customary for five hundred years to press him forward as
the great sufferer!). Then comes the cursing of all voluptuousness
(Baudelaire and Schopenhauer), the most decided conviction that the
lust of power is the greatest vice; absolute certainty that morality
and disinterestedness are identical things; that the "happiness of all"
is a goal worth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>striving after (<i>i.e.,</i> Christ's Kingdom of Heaven).
We are on the best road to it: the Kingdom of Heaven of the poor in
spirit has begun.&mdash;Intermediate stages: the bourgeois (as a result of
the <i>nouveau riche</i>) and the workman (as a result of the machine).</p>

<p>Greek and French culture of the time of Louis XIV. compared. A decided
belief in oneself. A leisure-class which makes things hard for itself
and exercises a great deal of self-control. The power of form, the will
to form <i>oneself.</i> "Happiness" acknowledged as a purpose. Much strength
and energy <i>behind</i> all formality of manners. Pleasure at the sight of
a life that is <i>seemingly so easy.</i> The <i>Greeks</i> seemed like <i>children</i>
to the French.</p>


<p class="parnum">95.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Three Centuries.</i></p>

<p>Their different kinds of <i>sensitiveness</i> may perhaps be best expressed
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aristocracy</i>: Descartes, the reign of <i>reason,</i> evidence showing the
sovereignty of the <i>will</i>.</p>

<p><i>Feminism</i>: Rousseau, the reign of <i>feeling,</i> evidence showing the
sovereignty of the senses; all lies.</p>

<p><i>Animalism</i>: Schopenhauer, the reign of <i>passion,</i> evidence showing the
sovereignty of animality, more honest, but gloomy.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century is <i>aristocratic,</i> all for order, haughty
towards everything animal, severe in regard to the heart, "austere,"
and even free from sentiment, "non-German," averse to all that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
burlesque and natural, generalising and maintaining an attitude of
sovereignty towards the past for it believes in itself. At bottom it
partakes very much of the beast of prey, and practises asceticism in
order to remain master. It is the century of strength of will, as also
that of strong passion.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century is dominated by <i>woman,</i> it is gushing,
spiritual, and flat; but with intellect at the service of aspirations
and of the heart, it is a libertine in the pleasures of intellect,
undermining all authorities; emotionally intoxicated, cheerful, clear,
humane, and sociable, false to itself and at bottom very rascally....</p>

<p>The nineteenth century is more <i>animal,</i> more subterranean, hateful,
realistic, plebeian, and on that very account "better," "more honest,"
more submissive to "reality" of what kind soever, and <i>truer</i>; but
weak of will, sad, obscurely exacting and fatalistic. It has no
feeling of timidity or reverence, either in the presence of "reason"
or the "heart"; thoroughly convinced of the dominion of the desires
(Schopenhauer said "Will," but nothing is more characteristic of his
philosophy than that it entirely lacks all actual <i>willing</i>). Even
morality is reduced to an instinct ("Pity").</p>

<p>Auguste Comte is <i>the continuation of the</i> eighteenth <i>century</i> (the
dominion of the heart over the head, sensuality in the theory of
knowledge, altruistic exaltation).</p>

<p>The fact that <i>science</i> has become as sovereign as it is to-day, proves
how the nineteenth century has <i>emancipated itself</i> from the dominion
of <i>ideals.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>A certain absence of "needs" and wishes makes our
scientific curiosity and rigour possible&mdash;this is our kind of virtue.</p>

<p>Romanticism is the <i>counterstroke</i> of the eighteenth century; a sort of
accumulated longing for its grand style of exaltation (as a matter of
fact, largely mingled with mummery and self-deception: the desire was
to represent <i>strong nature</i> and <i>strong passion</i>).</p>

<p>The nineteenth century instinctively goes in search of <i>theories</i>
by means of which it may feel its <i>fatalistic, submission to the
empire of facts</i> justified. Hegel's success against sentimentality
and romantic idealism was already a sign of its fatalistic trend of
thought, in its belief that superior reason belongs to the triumphant
side, and in its justification of the actual "state" (in the place of
"humanity," etc.).&mdash;Schopenhauer: we are something foolish, and at the
best self-suppressive. The success of determinism, the genealogical
derivation of <i>obligations</i> which were formerly held to be absolute,
the teaching of environment and adaptation, the reduction of will to
a process of reflex movement, the denial of the will as a "working
cause"; finally&mdash;a real process of re-christening: so little will
is observed that the word itself becomes <i>available</i> for another
purpose. Further theories: the teaching of <i>objectivity,</i> "will-less"
contemplation, as the only road to truth, <i>as also</i> to <i>beauty</i> (also
the belief in "genius," in order to have <i>the right to be submissive</i>);
mechanism, the determinable rigidity of the mechanical process;
so-called "Naturalism," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>the elimination of the choosing, directing,
interpreting subject, on principle.</p>

<p>Kant, with his "practical reason," with his <i>moral fanaticism,</i> is
quite eighteenth century style; still completely outside the historical
movement, without any notion whatsoever of the reality of his time, for
instance, revolution; he is not affected by Greek philosophy; he is a
phantasist of the notion of duty, a sensualist with a hidden leaning to
dogmatic pampering.</p>

<p><i>The return to Kant</i> in our century means a <i>return to the eighteenth
century,</i> people desire to create themselves a right to the <i>old ideas</i>
and to the old exaltation&mdash;hence a theory of knowledge which "describes
limits," that is to say, which admits <i>of the option of fixing a Beyond
to the domain of reason.</i></p>

<p><i>Hegel's</i> way of thinking is not so very far removed from that of
Goethe: see the latter on the subject of Spinoza, for instance.
The will to deify the All and Life, in order to find both <i>peace</i>
and <i>happiness</i> in contemplating them: Hegel looks for reason
everywhere&mdash;in the presence of reason man may be <i>submissive</i> and
resigned. In Goethe we find a kind of <i>fatalism</i> which is almost
<i>joyous</i> and <i>confiding,</i> which neither revolts nor weakens, which
strives to make a totality out of itself, in the belief that only in
totality does everything seem good and justified, and find itself
resolved.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century <i>suffers</i> from <i>humanity</i> as from a <i>host
of contradictions</i> ("<i>l'amas de contradictions</i>" that we are); it
endeavours to discover man, to <i>co-ordinate him,</i> to excavate him:
whereas the eighteenth century tries to forget what is known of man's
nature, in order to adapt him to its Utopia. "Superficial, soft,
humane"&mdash;gushes over "humanity."</p>

<p>The seventeenth century tries to banish all traces of the individual
in order that the artist's work may resemble life as much as possible.
The eighteenth century strives <i>to create interest in the author</i> by
means of the work. The seventeenth century seeks art in art, a piece of
culture; the eighteenth uses art in its propaganda for political and
social reforms.</p>

<p>"Utopia," the "ideal man," the deification of Nature, the vanity of
making one's own personality the centre of interest, subordination to
the propaganda of <i>social ideas,</i> charlatanism&mdash;all this we derive from
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The style of the seventeenth century: <i>propre exact et libre.</i></p>

<p>The strong individual who is self-sufficient, or who appeals
ardently to God&mdash;and that obtrusiveness and indiscretion of modern
authors&mdash;these things are <i>opposites.</i> "Showing-oneself-off"&mdash;what a
contrast to the Scholars of Port-Royal!</p>

<p><i>Against Rousseau.&mdash;Alas!</i> man is no longer sufficiently evil;
Rousseau's opponents, who say that "man is a beast of prey," are
unfortunately wrong. Not the corruption of man, but the softening and
moralising of him is the curse. In the sphere which Rousseau attacked
most violently, the <i>relatively</i> strongest and most successful type of
man was still to be found (the type which still possessed the great
passions intact: Will to Power, Will to Pleasure, the Will and Ability
to Command). The man of the eighteenth century must be compared with
the man of the Renaissance (also with the man of the seventeenth
century in France) if the matter is to be understood at all: Rousseau
is a symptom of self-contempt and of inflamed vanity&mdash;both signs that
the dominating will is lacking: he moralises and seeks the <i>cause</i> of
his own misery after the style of a revengeful man in the <i>ruling</i>
classes.</p>


<p class="parnum">99.</p>

<p><i>Voltaire&mdash;Rousseau.</i>&mdash;A state of nature is terrible; man is a beast of
prey: our civilisation is an extraordinary <i>triumph</i> over this beast of
prey in nature&mdash;this was <i>Voltaires</i> conclusion. He was conscious of
the mildness, the refinements, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>the intellectual joys of the civilised
state; he despised obtuseness, even in the form of virtue, and the lack
of delicacy even in ascetics and monks.</p>

<p>The <i>moral depravity</i> of man seemed to pre-occupy <i>Rousseau</i>; the words
"unjust," "cruel," are the best possible for the purpose of exciting
the instincts of the oppressed, who otherwise find themselves under
the ban of the <i>vetitum</i> and of disgrace; <i>so that their conscience
is opposed to their indulging any insurrectional desires.</i> These
emancipators seek one thing above all: to give their party the great
accents and attitudes of <i>higher Nature</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">100.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau</i>; the rule founded on sentiment; Nature as the source of
justice; man perfects himself in proportion as he approaches <i>Nature</i>
(according to Voltaire, in proportion <i>as he leaves Nature behind</i>).
The very same periods seem to the one to demonstrate the progress of
<i>humanity</i> and, to the other, the increase of injustice and inequality.</p>

<p>Voltaire, who still understood <i>umanità</i> in the sense of the
Renaissance, as also <i>virtù</i> (as "higher culture"), fights for the
cause of the "<i>honnêtes gens</i>" "<i>la bonne compagnie</i>" taste, science,
arts, and even for the cause of progress and civilisation.</p>

<p><i>The flare-up occurred towards 1760</i>: On the one hand the citizen
of Geneva, on the other <i>le seigneur de Ferney.</i> It is only from
that moment and henceforward that Voltaire was the man of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>his age,
the philosopher, the representative of Toleration and of Disbelief
(theretofore he had been merely <i>un bel esprit</i>). His envy and hatred
of Rousseau's success forced him upwards.</p>

<p>"<i>Pour 'la canaille' un dieu rémunérateur et vengeur</i>"&mdash;Voltaire.</p>

<p>The criticism of both standpoints in regard to the <i>value of
civilisation.</i> To Voltaire nothing seems finer than the <i>social
invention</i>: there is no higher goal than to uphold and perfect it.
<i>L'honnêteté</i> consists precisely in respecting social usage; virtue
in a certain obedience towards various necessary "prejudices" which
favour the maintenance of society. <i>Missionary of Culture,</i> aristocrat,
representative of the triumphant and ruling classes and their values.
But Rousseau remained a <i>plebeian,</i> even as <i>hommes de lettres,</i> this
was <i>preposterous</i>; his shameless contempt for everything that was not
himself.</p>

<p>The <i>morbid feature</i> in Rousseau is the one which happens to have been
most admired and <i>imitated.</i> (Lord Byron resembled him somewhat, he
too screwed himself up to sublime attitudes and to revengeful rage&mdash;a
sign of vulgarity; later on, when Venice restored his equilibrium,
he understood what <i>alleviates most</i> and does the <i>most good ...
l'insouciance</i>.)</p>

<p>In spite of his antecedents, Rousseau is proud of himself; but he is
incensed if he is reminded of his origin....</p>

<p>In Rousseau there was undoubtedly some brain trouble; in Voltaire&mdash;rare
health and lightsomeness. <i>The revengefulness of the sick</i>; his
periods <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>of insanity as also those of his contempt of man, and of his
mistrust.</p>

<p>Rousseau's defence of <i>Providence</i> (against Voltaire's Pessimism):
he <i>had need of</i> God in order to be able to curse society and
civilisation; everything must be good <i>per se,</i> because God had created
it; man <i>alone has corrupted man.</i> The "good man" as a man of Nature
was pure fantasy; but with the dogma of God's authorship he became
something probable and even not devoid of foundation.</p>

<p><i>Romanticism</i> à la <i>Rousseau</i>: passion ("the sovereign right of
passion"); "naturalness"; the fascination of madness (foolishness
reckoned as greatness); the senseless vanity of the weak; the
revengefulness of the masses elevated to the position of <i>justice</i>
("in politics, for one hundred years, the leader has always been this
invalid").</p>


<p class="parnum">101.</p>

<p><i>Kant</i>: makes the scepticism of Englishmen, in regard to the theory of
knowledge, <i>possible</i> for Germans.</p>

<p>(1) By enlisting in its cause the interest of the German's religious
and moral needs: just as the new academicians used scepticism for the
same reasons, as a preparation for Platonism (<i>vide</i> Augustine); just
as Pascal even used <i>moral</i> scepticism in order to provoke (to justify)
the need of belief;</p>

<p>(2) By complicating and entangling it with scholastic flourishes in
view of making it more <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>acceptable to the German's scientific taste in
form (for Locke and Hume, alone, were too illuminating, too clear&mdash;that
is to say, judged according to the German valuing instinct, "too
superficial").</p>

<p><i>Kant</i>: a poor psychologist and mediocre judge of human nature, made
hopeless mistakes in regard to great historical values (the French
Revolution); a moral fanatic <i>à la</i> Rousseau; with a subterranean
current of Christian values; a thorough dogmatist, but bored to
extinction by this tendency, to the extent of wishing to tyrannise
over it, but quickly tired, even of 'scepticism; and not yet affected
by any cosmopolitan thought or antique beauty ... a <i>dawdler</i> and a
<i>go-between,</i> not at all original (like <i>Leibnitz,</i> something between
mechanism and spiritualism; like <i>Goethe,</i> something between the taste
of the eighteenth century and that of the "historical sense" [which
<i>is</i> essentially a sense of exoticism]; like <i>German music,</i> between
French and Italian music; like Charles the Great, who mediated and
built bridges between the Roman Empire and Nationalism&mdash;a dawdler <i>par

<p>In what respect have the <i>Christian</i> centuries with their Pessimism

"spirit" and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>in taste)&mdash;how did it show an advance on the latter?

impression of the <i>Campagna romana.</i></p>

<p>The President de Brosses says of the <i>Campagna romana</i>: "Il fallait
que Romulus fût ivre quand il songea à bâtir une ville dans un terrain
aussi laid."</p>

<p>Even Delacroix would have nothing to do with Rome, it frightened him.
He loved Venice, just as Shakespeare, Byron, and Georges Sand did.
Théophile Gautier's and Richard Wagner's dislike of Rome must not be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Lamartine has the language for Sorrento and Posilippo.</p>

<p>The <i>two great attempts</i> that were made to overcome the eighteenth
century:</p>

<p><i>Napoleon,</i> in that he called man, the soldier, and the great struggle

<p><i>Goethe,</i> in that he imagined a European culture <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>which would consist
of the whole heritage of what humanity had <i>attained to</i> up to his time.</p>


<p>German culture in this century inspires mistrust&mdash;the music of the
period lacks that complete element which liberates and binds as well,
to wit&mdash;Goethe.</p>

<p>The pre-eminence of <i>music</i> in the romanticists of 1830 and 1840.
Delacroix. Ingres&mdash;a passionate musician (admired Gluck, Haydn,
Beethoven, Mozart), said to his pupils in Rome: "Si je pouvais vous
rendre tous musiciens, vous y gagneriez comme peintres"&mdash;likewise
Horace Vernet, who was particularly fond of Don Juan (as Mendelssohn
assures us, 1831); Stendhal, too, who says of himself: "Combien de
lieues ne ferais-je pas à pied, et à combien de jours de prison ne me
soumetterais-je pas pour entendre <i>Don Juan ou le Matrimonio segreto</i>;
et je ne sais pour quelle autre chose je ferais cet effort." He was
then fifty-six years old.</p>

<p>The borrowed forms, for instance: Brahms as a typical "Epigone,"
likewise Mendelssohn's cultured Protestantism (a former "soul" is
turned into poetry posthumously ...)</p>

<p>&mdash;the moral and poetical substitutions in Wagner, who used <i>one</i> art as
a stop-gap to make up for what another lacked.</p>

<p>&mdash;the "historical sense," inspiration derived from poems, sagas.</p>

<p>&mdash;that characteristic transformation of which G. Flaubert is the most
striking example among Frenchmen, and Richard Wagner the most striking
example among Germans, shows how the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>romantic belief in love and the
future changes into a longing for nonentity in 1830-50.</p>


<p class="parnum">106.</p>

<p>How is it that German music reaches its culminating point in the age of
German romanticism? How is it that German music lacks Goethe? On the
other hand, how much Schiller, or more exactly, how much "Thekla"<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is
there not in Beethoven!</p>

<p>Schumann has Eichendorff, Uhland, Heine, Hoffman, Tieck, in him.
Richard Wagner has Freischütz, Hoffmann, Grimm, the romantic Saga,
the mystic Catholicism of instinct, symbolism, "the free-spiritedness
of passion" (Rousseau's intention). The <i>Flying Dutchman</i> savours of
France, where <i>le ténébreux</i> (1830) was the type of the seducer.</p>

<p><i>The cult of music,</i> the revolutionary romanticism of form. Wagner
<i>synthesises</i> German and French romanticism.</p>

<p class="parnum">107.</p>

<p>From the point of view only of his value to Germany and to German
culture, Richard Wagner is still a great problem, perhaps a German
misfortune: in any case, however, a fatality. But what does it
matter? Is he not very much more than a German event? It also
seems to me that to no country on earth is he less related than to
Germany; nothing was prepared there for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>his advent; his whole type
is simply strange amongst Germans; there he stands in their midst,
wonderful, misunderstood, incomprehensible. But people carefully avoid
acknowledging this: they are too kind, too square-headed&mdash;too German
for that. "Credo quia absurdus est": thus did the German spirit wish
it to be, in this case too&mdash;hence it is content meanwhile to believe
everything Richard Wagner wanted to have believed about himself. In all
ages the spirit of Germany has been deficient in subtlety and divining
powers concerning psychological matters. Now that it happens to be
under the high pressure of patriotic nonsense and self-adoration, it is
visibly growing thicker and coarser: how could it therefore be equal to
the problem of Wagner!</p>


<p class="parnum">108.</p>

<p>The Germans <i>are</i> not yet anything, but they are <i>becoming</i> something;
that is why they have not yet any culture;&mdash;that is why they cannot
yet have any culture!&mdash;They are not yet anything: that means they are
all kinds of things. They are <i>becoming</i> something: that means that
they will one day cease from being all kinds of things. The latter is
at bottom only a wish, scarcely a hope yet. Fortunately it is a wish
with which one can live, a question of will, of work, of discipline, a
question of training, as also of resentment, of longing, of privation,
of discomfort,&mdash;yea, even of bitterness,&mdash;in short, we Germans <i>will</i>
get something out of ourselves, something that has not yet been wanted
of us&mdash;we want something <i>more</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
That this "German, as he is not as yet"&mdash;has a right to something
better than the present German "culture"; that all who wish to
become something better, must wax angry when they perceive a sort of
contentment, an impudent "setting-oneself-at-ease," or "a process of
self-censing," in this quarter: that is my second principle, in regard
to which my opinions have not yet changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<i>Generalised</i>: Every valuation is always <i>backward</i>; it is merely the

they are something higher.&mdash;For it might be <i>the prerequisite of

a concurrent Nihilistic movement. Under certain circumstances, the
appearance of <i>the extremest</i> form of Pessimism and actual <i>Nihilism</i>
might be the sign of a process of incisive and most essential growth,
and of mankind's transit into completely new conditions of existence.

<p>As a matter of fact, we are no longer so urgently in need of an
antidote against the first Nihilism: Life is no longer so uncertain,
accidental, and senseless in modern Europe. All such tremendous
<i>exaggeration</i> of the value of men, of the value of evil, etc., are
not so necessary now; we can endure a considerable diminution of this
value, we may grant a great deal of nonsense and accident: the <i>power</i>

origin, the pessimists, Nihilists, romanticists of pity, criminals, and
men of vicious habits&mdash;the whole sphere in which the idea of "God" is
that of <i>Saviour....</i></p>

<p>We are proud of being no longer obliged to be liars, slanderers, and
detractors of Life....</p>

<p><i>The advance</i> of the nineteenth century upon the eighteenth (at bottom
we <i>good Europeans</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>are carrying on a war against the eighteenth
century):</p>

<p>(1) "The return to Nature" is getting to be understood, ever more
definitely, in a way which is quite the reverse of that in which
Rousseau used the phrase&mdash;<i>away from idylls and operas!</i></p>

<p>(2) Ever more decided, more anti-idealistic, more objective, more
fearless, more industrious, more temperate, more suspicious of sudden
changes, <i>anti-revolutionary</i>;</p>

<p>(3) The question of <i>bodily health</i> is being pressed ever more
decidedly in front of the health of "the soul": the latter is regarded
as a condition brought about by the former, and bodily health is
believed to be, at least, the prerequisite to spiritual health.</p>


<p class="parnum">118.</p>

<p>If anything at all has been achieved, it is a more innocent attitude
towards the senses, a happier, more favourable demeanour in regard
to sensuality, resembling rather the position taken up by Goethe; a
prouder feeling has also been developed in knowledge, and the "reine
Thor"<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> meets with little faith.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_7" id="Footnote_6_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_7"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This is a reference to Wagner's <i>Parsifal.</i> The character
as is well known, is written to represent a son of heart's affliction,
and a child of wisdom&mdash;humble, guileless, loving, pure, and a
fool.&mdash;<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.</span></p></div>


<p class="parnum">119.</p>

<p>We "<i>objective people.</i>"&mdash;It is not "pity" that opens up the way for
<i>us</i> to all that is most remote and most strange in life and culture;
but our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>accessibility and ingenuousness, which precisely does not
"pity," but rather takes pleasure in hundreds of things which formerly
caused pain (which in former days either outraged or moved us, or in
the presence of which we were either hostile or indifferent). Pain in
all its various phases is now interesting to us: on that account we are
certainly <i>not</i> the more pitiful, even though the sight of pain may
shake us to our foundations and move us to tears: and we are absolutely
not inclined to be more helpful in view thereof.</p>

<p>In this <i>deliberate</i> desire to look on at all pain and error, we have
grown stronger and more powerful than in the eighteenth century; it
is a proof of our increase of strength (we have <i>drawn closer</i> to the
seventeenth and sixteenth centuries). But it is a profound mistake
to regard our "romanticism" as a proof of our "beautified souls." We
want <i>stronger</i> sensations than all <i>coarser</i> ages and classes have
wanted. (This fact must not be confounded with the needs of neurotics
and decadents; in their case, of course, there is a craving for pepper
&mdash;even for cruelty.)</p>

<p>We are all seeking conditions <i>which are emancipated from</i> the
bourgeois, and to a greater degree from the priestly, notion of
morality (every book which savours at all of priestdom and theology
gives us the impression of pitiful <i>niaiserie</i> and mental indigence).
"Good company," in fact, finds everything insipid which is not
forbidden and considered compromising in bourgeois circles; and the
case is the same with books, music, politics, and opinions on women.</p>

<p class="parnum">120.</p>

<p><i>The simplification of man in the nineteenth century</i> (The eighteenth
century was that of elegance, subtlety, and generous feeling).&mdash;Not
"return to nature"; for no natural humanity has ever existed yet.
Scholastic, unnatural, and antinatural values are the rule and the
beginning; man only reaches Nature after a long struggle&mdash;he never
turns his "back" to her.... To be natural means, to dare to be as
immoral as Nature is.</p>

<p>We are coarser, more direct, richer in irony towards generous feelings,
even when we are beneath them.</p>

<p>Our <i>haute volée,</i> the society consisting of our rich and leisured
men, is more natural: people hunt each other, the love of the sexes
is a kind of sport in which marriage is both a charm and an obstacle;
people entertain each other and live for the sake of pleasure; bodily
advantages stand in the first rank, and curiosity and daring are the
rule.</p>

<p>Our attitude towards <i>knowledge</i> is more natural; we are innocent
in our absolute spiritual debauchery, we hate pathetic and hieratic
manners, we delight in that which is most strictly prohibited, we
should scarcely recognise any interest in knowledge if we were bored in
acquiring it.</p>

<p>Our attitude to <i>morality</i> is also more natural. Principles have become
a laughing-stock; no one dares to speak of his "duty," unless in irony.
But a helpful, benevolent disposition is highly valued. (Morality is
located in <i>instinct</i> and the rest is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>despised. Besides this there are
few points of honour.)</p>

<p>Our attitude to <i>politics</i> is more natural: we see problems of power,
of the quantum of power, against another quantum. We do not believe in
a right that does not proceed from a power which is able to uphold it.
We regard all rights as conquests.</p>

<p>Our valuation of <i>great men and things</i> is more natural: we regard
passion as a privilege; we can conceive of nothing great which does not
involve a great crime; all greatness is associated in our minds with a
certain standing-beyond-the-pale in morality.</p>

<p>Our attitude to <i>Nature</i> is more natural: we no longer love her for her
"innocence," her "reason," her "beauty," we have made her beautifully
devilish and "foolish." But instead of despising her on that account,
since then we have felt more closely related to her and more familiar
in her presence. She does <i>not</i> aspire to virtue: we therefore respect
her.</p>

<p>Our attitude towards <i>Art</i> is more natural: we do not exact beautiful,
empty lies, etc., from her; brutal positivism reigns supreme, and it
ascertains things with perfect calm.</p>

<p>In short: there are signs showing that the European of the nineteenth
century is less ashamed of his instincts; he has gone a long way
towards acknowledging his unconditional naturalness and immorality,
<i>without bitterness</i>: on the contrary, he is strong enough to endure
this point of view alone.</p>

<p>To some ears this will sound as though <i>corruption</i> had made strides:
and certain it is that man has not drawn nearer to the "Nature"
which Rousseau <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>speaks about, but has gone one step farther in the
civilisation before which Rousseau <i>stood in horror.</i> We have grown
<i>stronger,</i> we have drawn nearer to the seventeenth century, more
particularly to the taste which reigned towards its close (Dancourt, Le
Sage, Renard).</p>


<p class="parnum">121.</p>

<p><i>Culture</i> versus <i>Civilisation.</i>&mdash;The culminating stages of culture
and civilisation lie apart: one must not be led astray as regards the
fundamental antagonism existing between culture and civilisation.
From the moral standpoint, great periods in the history of culture
have always been periods of corruption; while on the other hand,
those periods in which man was deliberately and compulsorily <i>tamed</i>
("civilisation") have always been periods of intolerance towards the
most intellectual and most audacious natures. Civilisation desires
something different from what culture strives after: their aims may
perhaps be opposed....</p>


<p class="parnum">122.</p>

<p><i>What I warn people against</i>: confounding the instincts of decadence
with those of <i>humanity</i>;</p>

<p>Confounding the <i>dissolving means</i> of civilisation <i>and those which
necessarily promote decadence,</i> with <i>culture</i>;</p>

<p>Confounding <i>debauchery,</i> and the principle, "laisser aller," with the
<i>Will to Power</i> (the latter is the exact reverse of the former).</p>

<p>The unsolved problems which I set anew: the <i>problem of civilisation,</i>
the struggle between Rousseau and Voltaire about the year 1760. Man
becomes deeper, more mistrustful, more "immoral," stronger, more
self-confident&mdash;and therefore "<i>more natural</i>"; that is "progress."
In this way, by a process of division of labour, the more evil strata
and the milder and tamer strata of society get separated: so that <i>the
general facts</i> are not visible at first sight.... It is a sign of
<i>strength,</i> and of the self-control and fascination of the strong, that
these stronger strata possess the arts in order to make their greater
powers for evil felt as something "<i>higher</i>" As soon as there is
"progress" there is a transvaluation of the strengthened factors into
the "good."</p>


<p class="parnum">124.</p>

<p>Man must have the <i>courage</i> of his natural instincts restored to him.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The poor opinion</i> he has of himself must be destroyed (<i>not</i> in the
sense of the individual, but in the sense of the <i>natural</i> man ...)&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>contradictions</i> in things must be eradicated, after it has been
well understood that we were responsible for them&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Social idiosyncrasies</i> must be stamped out of existence (guilt,
punishment, justice, honesty, freedom, love, etc. etc.)&mdash;</p>

<p>An advance towards "<i>naturalness</i>": in all political questions, even
in the relations between parties, even in merchants', workmen's, or
contractors' <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>parties, only <i>questions</i> of <i>power</i> come into play:&mdash;
"what one <i>can</i> do" is the first question, what one ought to do is only
a secondary consideration.</p>


<p class="parnum">125.</p>

<p>Socialism&mdash;or the <i>tyranny</i> of the meanest and the most
brainless,&mdash;that is to say, the superficial, the envious, and the
mummers, brought to its zenith,&mdash;is, as a matter, of fact, the logical
conclusion of "modern ideas" and their latent anarchy: but in the
genial atmosphere of democratic well-being the capacity for forming
resolutions or even for coming <i>to an end</i> at all, is paralysed. Men
follow&mdash;but no longer their reason. That is why socialism is on the
whole a hopelessly bitter affair: and there is nothing more amusing
than to observe the discord between the poisonous and desperate faces
of present-day socialists&mdash;and what wretched and nonsensical feelings
does not their style reveal to us!&mdash;and the childish lamblike happiness
of their hopes and desires. Nevertheless, in many places in Europe,
there may be violent hand-to-hand struggles and irruptions on their
account: the coming century is likely to be convulsed in more than
one spot, and the Paris Commune, which finds defenders and advocates
even in Germany, will seem to have been but a slight indigestion
compared with what is to come. Be this as it may, there will always
be too many people of property for socialism ever to signify anything
more than an attack of illness: and these people of property are like
one man with one faith, "one must possess something in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>order <i>to
be</i> some one." This, however, is the oldest and most wholesome of
all instincts; I should add: "one must desire more than one has in
order to <i>become</i> more." For this is the teaching which life itself
preaches to all living things: the morality of Development. To have
and to wish to have more, in a word, <i>Growth</i>&mdash;that is life itself.
In the teaching of socialism "a will to the denial of life" is but
poorly concealed: botched men and races they must be who have devised
a teaching of this sort. In fact, I even wish a few experiments might
be made to show that in a socialistic society, life denies itself,
and itself cuts away its own roots. The earth is big enough and man
is still unexhausted enough for a practical lesson of this sort and
<i>demonstratio ad absurdum</i>&mdash;even if it were accomplished only by a vast
expenditure of lives&mdash;to seem worth while to me. Still, Socialism,
like a restless mole beneath the foundations of a society wallowing in
stupidity, will be able to achieve something useful and salutary: it
delays "Peace on Earth" and the whole process of character-softening of
the democratic herding animal; it forces the European to have an extra
supply of intellect,&mdash;that is to say, craft and caution, and prevents
his entirely abandoning the manly and warlike qualities,&mdash;it also saves
Europe awhile from the <i>marasmus femininus</i> which is threatening it.</p>

<p>The most favourable obstacles and remedies of modernity:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
(1) Compulsory <i>military service</i> with real wars in which all joking is
laid aside.</p>

<p>(2) <i>National</i> thick-headedness (which simplifies and concentrates).</p>

<p>(3) Improved <i>nutrition</i> (meat).</p>

<p>(4) Increasing <i>cleanliness</i> and wholesomeness in the home.</p>

<p>(5) The predominance of <i>physiology</i> over theology, morality,
economics, and politics.</p>

<p>(6) Military discipline in the exaction and the practice of one's
"duty" (it is no longer customary to praise).</p>


<p class="parnum">127.</p>



<p>I am delighted at the military development of Europe, also at the inner
anarchical conditions: the period of quietude and "Chinadom" which
Galiani prophesied for this century is now over. Personal and <i>manly</i>
capacity, bodily capacity recovers its value, valuations are becoming
more physical, nutrition consists ever more and more of flesh. Fine
men have once more become possible. Bloodless sneaks (with mandarins
at their head, as Comte imagined them) are now a matter of the past.
The savage in every one of us is <i>acknowledged,</i> even the wild animal.
<i>Precisely on that account,</i> philosophers will have a better chance.
&mdash;Kant is a scarecrow!</p>


<p class="parnum">128.</p>

<p>I have not yet <i>seen</i> any reasons to feel discouraged. He who acquires
and preserves a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><i>strong will,</i> together with a broad mind, has a more
favourable chance now than ever he had. For the <i>plasticity</i> of man has
become exceedingly great in democratic Europe: men who learn easily,
who readily adapt themselves, are the rule: the gregarious animal of
a high order of intelligence is prepared. He who would command finds
those who <i>must</i> obey: I have Napoleon and Bismarck in mind, for
instance. The struggle against strong and unintelligent wills, which
forms the surest obstacle in one's way, is really insignificant Who
would not be able to knock down these "objective" gentlemen with weak
wills, such as Ranke and Renan!</p>


<p class="parnum">129.</p>

<p><i>Spiritual enlightenment</i> is an unfailing means of making men
uncertain, weak of will, and needful of succour and support; in
short, of developing the herding instincts in them. That is why all
great artist-rulers, hitherto (Confucius in China, the Roman Empire,
Napoleon, Popedom&mdash;at a time when they had the courage of their
worldliness and frankly pursued power) in whom the ruling instincts,
that had prevailed until their time, culminated, also made use of the
spiritual enlightenment&mdash;or at least allowed it to be supreme (after
the style of the Popes of the Renaissance). The self-deception of
the masses on this point, in every democracy for instance, is of the
greatest possible value: all that makes men smaller and more amenable
is pursued under the title "progress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">130.</p>

<p>The highest equity and mildness as a condition of <i>weakness</i> (the New
Testament and the early Christian community&mdash;manifesting itself in the
form of utter foolishness in the Englishmen, Darwin and Wallace). Your
equity, ye higher men, drives you to universal suffrage, etc.; your
"humanity" urges you to be milder towards crime and stupidity. In the
<i>end</i> you will thus help stupidity and harmlessness to conquer.</p>

<p><i>Outwardly</i>: Ages of terrible wars, insurrections, explosions.
<i>Inwardly</i>: ever more and more weakness among men; <i>events</i> take the
<i>form of excitants.</i> The Parisian as the type of the European extreme.</p>

<p><i>Consequences</i>: (1) Savages (at first, of course, in conformity with
the culture that has reigned hitherto); (2) <i>Sovereign individuals</i>
(where <i>powerful</i> barbarous <i>masses</i> and emancipation from all that
has been, are crossed). The age of greatest stupidity, brutality, and
wretchedness in the masses, and <i>in the highest individuals.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">131.</p>

<p>An incalculable number of higher individuals now perish: but he who
<i>escapes their fate</i> is as strong as the devil. In this respect we are
reminded of the conditions which prevailed in the Renaissance.</p>

<p>How are <i>Good Europeans</i> such as ourselves distinguished from the
patriots? In the first place, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>we are atheists and immoralists, but we
take care to support the religions and the morality which we associate
with the gregarious instinct: for by means of them, an order of men is,
so to speak, being prepared, which must at some time or other fall into
our hands, which must actually <i>crave</i> for our hands.</p>

<p>Beyond Good and Evil,&mdash;certainly; but we insist upon the unconditional
and strict preservation of herd-morality.</p>

<p>We reserve ourselves the right to several kinds of philosophy which it
is necessary to learn: under certain circumstances, the pessimistic
kind as a hammer; a European Buddhism might perhaps be indispensable.</p>

<p>We should probably support the development and the maturation of
democratic tendencies; for it conduces to weakness of will: in
"Socialism" we recognise a thorn which prevents smug ease.</p>

<p>Attitude towards the people.. Our prejudices; we pay attention to the
results of cross-breeding.</p>

<p>Detached, well-to-do, strong: irony concerning the "press" and its
culture. Our care: that scientific men should not become journalists.
We mistrust any form of culture that tolerates news-paper reading or
writing.</p>

<p>We make our accidental positions (as Goethe and Stendhal did), our
experiences, a foreground, and we lay stress upon them, so that we
may deceive concerning our backgrounds. We ourselves <i>wait</i> and
avoid putting our heart into them. They serve us as refuges, such as
a wanderer might require and use&mdash;but we avoid feeling at home in
them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>We are ahead of our fellows in that we have had a <i>disciplina
voluntatis.</i> All strength is directed to the <i>development of the will,</i>
an art which allows us to wear masks, an art of understanding <i>beyond</i>
the passions (also "super-European" thought at times).</p>

<p>This is our preparation before becoming the law-givers of the future

ne ferait pas la guerre.</i>" As I in no way share the unwarlike views of
my deceased friend Galiani, I have no fear whatever of saying something
beforehand with the view of conjuring in some way the cause of wars.</p>

<p class="title">1. Concerning the Origin of Religions.</p>


<p class="parnum">135.</p>

<p><i>The origin of religion.</i>&mdash;Just as the illiterate man of to-day
believes that his wrath is the cause of his being angry, that his
mind is the cause of his thinking, that his soul is the cause of
his feeling, in short, just as a mass of psychological entities
are still unthinkingly postulated as causes; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>so, in a still more
primitive age, the same phenomena were interpreted by man by means of
personal entities. Those conditions of his soul which seemed strange,
overwhelming, and rapturous, he regarded as obsessions and bewitching
influences emanating from the power of some personality. (Thus the
Christian, the most puerile and backward man of this age, traces hope,
peace, and the feeling of deliverance to a psychological inspiration
on the part of God: being by nature a sufferer and a creature in need
of repose, states of happiness, peace, and resignation, perforce seem
strange to him, and seem to need some explanation.) Among intelligent,
strong, and vigorous races, the epileptic is mostly the cause of a
belief in the existence of some <i>foreign power</i>; but all such examples
of apparent subjection&mdash;as, for instance, the bearing of the exalted
man, of the poet, of the great criminal, or the passions, love and
revenge&mdash;lead to the invention of supernatural powers. A condition is
made concrete by being identified with a personality, and when this
condition overtakes anybody, it is ascribed to that personality. In
other words: in the psychological concept of God, a certain state of
the soul is personified as a cause in order to appear as an effect.</p>

<p>The psychological logic is as follows: when the <i>feeling of power</i>
suddenly seizes and overwhelms a man,&mdash;and this takes place in the
case of all the great passions,&mdash;a doubt arises in him concerning his
own person: he dare not think himself the cause of this astonishing
sensation&mdash;and thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>he posits a <i>stronger</i> person, a Godhead as its
cause. In short, the origin of religion lies in the extreme feelings
of power, which, being <i>strange,</i> take men by surprise: and just
as the sick man, who feels one of his limbs unaccountably heavy,
concludes that another man must be sitting on it, so the ingenuous
<i>homo religiosus,</i> divides himself up into <i>several people.</i> Religion
is an example of the "<i>altération de la personalité.</i>" A sort of <i>fear</i>
and <i>sensation of terror</i> in one's own presence.... But also a feeling
of inordinate <i>rapture</i> and <i>exaltation.</i> Among sick people, the
<i>sensation of health</i> suffices to awaken a belief in the proximity of
God.</p>


<p class="parnum">136.</p>

<p><i>Rudimentary psychology of the religious man:&mdash;</i>All changes are
effects; all effects are effects of will (the notion of "Nature"
and of "natural law," is lacking); all effects presuppose an agent.
Rudimentary psychology: one is only a cause oneself, when one knows
that one has willed something.</p>

<p>Result: States of power impute to man the feeling that he is <i>not</i> the
cause of them, that he is not <i>responsible</i> for them: they come without
being willed to do so&mdash;consequently we cannot be their originators:
will that is not free (that is to say, the knowledge of a change in our
condition which we have not helped to bring about) requires a <i>strong</i>
will.</p>

<p><i>Consequence of this rudimentary psychology</i>: Man has never dared to
credit <i>himself</i> with his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>strong and startling moods, he has always
conceived them as "passive," as "imposed upon him from outside":
Religion is the offshoot of a <i>doubt</i> concerning the entity of the
person, an <i>altération</i> of the personality: in so far as everything
great and strong in man was considered <i>superhuman</i> and <i>foreign,</i> man
belittled himself,&mdash;he laid the two sides, the very pitiable and weak
side, and the very strong and startling side apart, in two spheres, and
called the one "Man" and the other "God."</p>

<p>And he has continued to act on these lines; during the period of the
<i>moral idiosyncrasy</i> he did not interpret his lofty and sublime moral
states as "proceeding from his own will" or as the "work" of the
person. Even the Christian himself divides his personality into two
parts, the one a mean and weak fiction which he calls man, and the
other which he calls God (Deliverer and Saviour).</p>

<p>Religion has lowered the concept "man"; its ultimate conclusion is
that all goodness, greatness, and truth are superhuman, and are only
obtainable by the grace of God.</p>

<p>One way of raising man out of his self-abasement, which brought about
the decline of the point of view that classed all lofty and strong
states of the soul, as strange, was the theory of relationship. These
lofty and strong states of the soul could at least be interpreted as
the influence of our <i>forebears</i>; we belonged to each other, we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
irrevocably joined; we grew in our own esteem, by acting according to
the example of a model known to us all.</p>

<p>There is an attempt on the part of noble families to associate religion
with their own feelings of self-respect. Poets and seers do the same
thing; they feel proud that they have been worthy,&mdash;that they have been
<i>selected</i> for such association,&mdash;they esteem it an honour, not to be
considered at all as individuals, but as mere mouthpieces (Homer).</p>

<p>Man gradually takes possession of the highest and proudest states of
his soul, as also of his acts and his works. Formerly it was believed
that one paid oneself the greatest honour by denying one's own
responsibility for the highest deeds one accomplished, and by ascribing
them to&mdash;God. The will which was not free, appeared to be that which
imparted a higher value to a deed: in those days a god was postulated
as the author of the deed.</p>


<p class="parnum">138.</p>

<p>Priests are the actors of something which is supernatural, either in
the way of ideals, gods, or saviours, and they have to make people
believe in them; in this they find their calling, this is the purpose
of their instincts; in order to make it as credible as possible, they
have to exert themselves to the utmost extent in the art of posing;
their actor's sagacity must, above all, aim at giving them <i>a clean
conscience,</i> by means of which, alone, it is possible to persuade
effectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">139.</p>

<p>The priest wishes to make it an understood thing, that he is the
<i>highest type</i> of man, that he rules,&mdash;even over those who wield the
power,&mdash;that he is indispensable and unassailable,&mdash;that he is the
<i>strongest power</i> in the community, not by any means to be replaced or
undervalued.</p>

<p><i>Means thereto</i>: he alone is cultured; he alone is the <i>man of virtue</i>;
he alone has <i>sovereign power over himself</i>: he alone is, in a certain
sense, God, and ultimately goes back to the Godhead; he alone is the
middleman between God and <i>others</i>; the Godhead administers punishment
to every one who puts the priest at a disadvantage, or who thinks in
opposition to him.</p>

<p><i>Means thereto: Truth</i> exists. There is only one way of attaining to
it, and that is to become a priest. Everything good, which relates
either to order, nature, or tradition, is to be traced to the wisdom
of the priests. The Holy Book is their work. The whole of nature is
only a fulfilment of the maxims which it contains. No other <i>source of
goodness</i> exists than the priests. Every other kind of perfection, even
the <i>warrior's,</i> is different in rank from that of the priests.</p>

<p><i>Consequence</i>: If the priest is to be the <i>highest</i> type, then the
<i>degrees</i> which lead to his <i>virtues</i> must be the degrees of value
among men. <i>Study, emancipation from material things, inactivity,
impassibility, absence of passion, solemnity</i>;&mdash;the opposite of all
this is found in the <i>lowest</i> type of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The priest has taught a kind of morality which conduced to his being
considered the <i>highest type</i> of man. He conceives a <i>type</i> which
is the <i>reverse</i> of his own: the Chandala. By making <i>these</i> as
contemptible as possible, some strength is lent to the <i>order of
castes.</i> The priest's excessive fear of <i>sensuality</i> also implies that
the latter is the most serious threat to the <i>order of castes</i> (that is
to say, <i>order</i> in general).... Every "free tendency" <i>in puncto puncti
overthrows</i> the laws of marriage.</p>


<p class="parnum">140.</p>

<p>The <i>philosopher</i> considered as the development of the <i>priestly</i>
type:&mdash;He has the heritage of the priest in his blood; even as a rival
he is compelled to fight with the same weapons as the priest of his
time;&mdash;he aspires to the <i>highest authority.</i></p>

<p>What is it that bestows <i>authority</i> upon men who have no physical power
to wield (no army, no arms at all ...)? How do such men gain authority
<i>over</i> those who are in possession of material power, and who represent
authority? (Philosophers enter the lists against princes, victorious
conquerors, and wise statesmen.)</p>

<p>They can do it only by establishing the belief that they are in
possession of a power which is higher and stronger&mdash;<i>God.</i> Nothing is
strong enough: every one is in <i>need</i> of the mediation and the services
of priests. They establish themselves as indispensable <i>intercessors.</i>
The conditions of their existence are: (1) That people believe in the
absolute superiority of their god, in fact believe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>in <i>their god</i>;
(2) that there is no other access, no direct access to god, save
through them. The <i>second</i> condition alone gives rise to the concept
"heterodoxy"; the <i>first</i> to the concept "disbelievers" (that is to
say, he who believes in another god).</p>


<p class="parnum">141.</p>

<p><i>A Criticism of the Holy Lie.</i>&mdash;That a lie is allowed in pursuit
of holy ends 'is a principle which belongs to the theory of all
priestcraft, and the object of this inquiry is to discover to what
extent it belongs to its practice.</p>

<p>But philosophers, too, whenever they intend taking over the leadership
of mankind, with the ulterior motives of priests in their minds, have
never failed to arrogate to themselves the right to lie: Plato above
all. But the most elaborate of lies is the double lie, developed
by the typically Arian philosophers of the Vedanta: two systems,
contradicting each other in all their main points, but interchangeable,
complementary, and mutually expletory, when educational ends were in
question. The lie of the one has to create a condition in which the
truth of the other can alone become <i>intelligible....</i></p>

<p>How <i>far</i> does the holy lie of priests and philosophers go?&mdash;The
question here is, what hypotheses do they advance in regard to
education, and what are the dogmas they are compelled to <i>invent</i> in
order to do justice to these hypotheses?</p>

<p>First: they must have power, authority, and absolute credibility on
their side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Secondly: they must have the direction of the whole of Nature, so that
everything affecting the individual seems to be determined by their law.</p>

<p>Thirdly: their domain of power must be very extensive, in order that
its control may escape the notice of those they subject: they must know
the penal code of the life beyond&mdash;of the life "after death,"&mdash;and, of
course, the means whereby the road to blessedness may be discovered.
They have to put the notion of a natural course of things out of sight,
but as they are intelligent and thoughtful people, they are able to
<i>promise</i> a host of effects, which they naturally say are conditioned
by prayer or by the strict observance of their law. They can, moreover,
<i>prescribe</i> a large number of things which are exceedingly reasonable
&mdash;only they must not point to experience or empiricism as the source
of this wisdom, but to revelation or to the fruits of the "most severe
exercises of penance."</p>

<p>The <i>holy lie,</i> therefore, applies principally to the <i>purpose</i> of
an action (the natural purpose, reason, is made to vanish: a moral
purpose, the observance of some law, a service to God, seems to be the
purpose): to the <i>consequence</i> of an action (the natural consequence
is interpreted as something supernatural, and, in order to be on
surer ground, other incontrollable and supernatural consequences are
foretold).</p>

<p>In this way the concepts <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> are created, and seem
quite divorced from the natural concepts: "useful," "harmful,"
"life-promoting," "life-retarding,"&mdash;indeed, inasmuch as <i>another</i>
life <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>is imagined, the former concepts may even be <i>antagonistic</i> to
Nature's concepts of good and evil. In this way, the proverbial concept
"conscience" is created: an inner voice, which, though it makes itself
heard in regard to every action, does not measure the worth of that
action according to its results, but according to its conformity or
non-conformity to the "law."</p>

<p>The holy lie therefore invented: (1) a <i>god</i> who <i>punishes</i> and
<i>rewards,</i> who recognises and carefully observes the law-book of the
priests, and who is particular about sending them into the world as
his mouthpieces and plenipotentiaries; (2) an <i>After Life,</i> in which,
alone, the great penal machine is supposed to be active&mdash;to this end
the <i>immortality of the soul</i> was invented; (3) a <i>conscience in
man,</i> understood as the knowledge that good and evil are permanent
values&mdash;that God himself speaks through it, whenever its counsels are
in conformity with priestly precepts; (4) <i>Morality</i> as the denial of
all natural processes, as the subjection of all phenomena to a moral
order, as the interpretation of all phenomena as the effects of a moral
order of things (that is to say, the concept of punishment and reward),
as the only power and only creator of all transformations; (5) <i>Truths</i>
given, revealed, and identical with the teaching of the priests: as the
condition to all salvation and happiness in this and the next world.</p>

<p><i>In short</i>: what is the price paid for the <i>improvement</i> supposed
to be due to morality?&mdash;The unhinging of <i>reason,</i> the reduction of
all motives to fear and hope (punishment and reward); <i>dependence</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
upon the tutelage of priests, and upon a formulary exactitude
which is supposed to express a divine will; the implantation of
a "conscience" which establishes a false science in the place of
experience and experiment: as though all one had to do or had not
to do were predetermined&mdash;a kind of contraction of the seeking and
striving spirit;&mdash;<i>in short</i>: the worst <i>mutilation</i> of man that can be
imagined, and it is pretended that "the good man" is the result.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, all reason, the whole heritage of intelligence,
subtlety, and caution, the first condition of the priestly canon, is
arbitrarily reduced, when it is too late, to a simple <i>mechanical</i>
process: conformity with the law becomes a purpose in itself, it is the
highest purpose; <i>Life no longer contains any problems</i>;&mdash;the whole
conception of the world is polluted by the notion of <i>punishment</i>;
&mdash;Life itself, owing to the fact that the <i>priests life</i> is upheld as
the <i>non plus ultra</i> of perfection, is transformed into a denial and
pollution of life;&mdash;the concept "God" represents an aversion to Life,
and even a criticism and a contemning of it. Truth is transformed in
the mind, into <i>priestly</i> prevarication; the striving after truth, into
the <i>study of the Scriptures,</i> into the way to <i>become a theologian.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">142.</p>

<p><i>A criticism of the Law-Book of Manu.</i>&mdash;The whole book is founded upon
the holy lie. Was it the well-being of humanity that inspired the whole
of this system? Was this kind of man, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>who believes in the <i>interested</i>
nature of every action, interested or not interested in the success
of this system? The desire to improve mankind&mdash;whence comes the
inspiration to this feeling? Whence is the concept improvement taken?</p>

<p>We find a class of men, <i>the sacerdotal class,</i> who consider themselves
the standard pattern, the highest example and most perfect expression
of the type man. The notion of "improving" mankind, to this class of
men, means to make mankind like themselves. They believe in their own
superiority, they <i>will</i> be superior in practice: the cause of the holy
lie is <i>The Will to Power....</i></p>

<p>Establishment of the dominion: to this end, ideas which place a <i>non
plus ultra</i> of power with the priesthood are made to prevail. Power
acquired by lying was the result of the recognition of the fact that it
was not already possessed physically, in a military form.... Lying as a
supplement to power&mdash;this is a new concept of "truth."</p>

<p>It is a mistake to presuppose <i>unconscious</i> and <i>innocent</i> development
in this quarter&mdash;a sort of self-deception. Fanatics are not the
discoverers of such exhaustive systems of oppression.... Cold-blooded
reflection must have been at work here; the same sort of reflection
which Plato showed when he worked out his "State"&mdash;"One must desire the
means when one desires the end." Concerning this political maxim, all
legislators have always been quite clear.</p>

<p>We possess the classical model, and it is specifically Arian: we
can therefore hold the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>gifted and most reflective type of man
responsible for the most systematic lie that has ever been told....
Everywhere almost the lie was copied, and thus <i>Avian influence</i>
corrupted the world....</p>


<p class="parnum">143.</p>

<p>Much is said to-day about the <i>Semitic</i> spirit of the <i>New Testament</i>:
but the thing referred to is merely priestcraft,&mdash;and in the purest
example of an Arian law-book, in Manu, this kind of "Semitic
spirit"&mdash;that is to say, <i>Sacerdotalism,</i> is worse than anywhere else.</p>

<p>The development of the Jewish hierarchy is <i>not</i> original: they learnt
the scheme in Babylon&mdash;it is Arian. When, later on, the same thing
became dominant in Europe, under the preponderance of Germanic blood,
this was in conformity to the spirit of the <i>ruling race</i>: a striking
case of atavism. The Germanic middle ages aimed at a revival of the
<i>Arian order of castes</i>.</p>

<p>Mohammedanism in its turn learned from Christianity the use of a
"Beyond" as an instrument of punishment.</p>

<p>The scheme of a <i>permanent community,</i> with priests at its
head&mdash;this oldest product of Asia's great culture in the domain of
organisation&mdash;<i>naturally</i> provoked reflection and imitation in every
way.&mdash;Plato is an example of this, but above all, the Egyptians.</p>


<p class="parnum">144.</p>

<p><i>Moralities</i> and <i>religions</i> are the principal means by which one can
modify men into whatever one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>; provided one is possessed of an
overflow of creative power, and can cause one's will to prevail over
long periods of time.</p>


<p class="parnum">145.</p>

<p>If one wish to see an <i>affirmative</i> Arian religion which is the product
of a <i>ruling</i> class, one should read the law-book of Manu. (The
deification of the feeling of power in the Brahmin: it is interesting
to note that it originated in the warrior-caste, and was later
transferred to the priests.)</p>

<p>If one wish to see an <i>affirmative</i> religion of the Semitic order,
which is the product of the <i>ruling</i> class, one should read the Koran
or the earlier portions of the Old Testament. (<i>Mohammedanism,</i> as a
religion for men, has profound contempt for the sentimentality and
prevarication of Christianity, ... which, according to Mohammedans, is
a woman's religion.)</p>

<p>If one wish to see a <i>negative</i> religion of the Semitic order, which is
the product of the <i>oppressed</i> class, one should read the New Testament
(which, according to Indian and Arian points of view, is a religion for
the Chandala).</p>

<p>If one wish to see a <i>negative</i> Arian religion, which is the product of
the <i>ruling</i> classes, one should study Buddhism.</p>

<p>It is quite in the nature of things that we have no Arian religion
which is the product of the <i>oppressed</i> classes; for that would have
been a contradiction: a race of masters is either paramount or else it
goes to the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="parnum">146.</p>

<p>Religion, <i>per se,</i> has nothing to do with morality; yet both offshoots
of the Jewish religion are <i>essentially</i> moral religions&mdash;which
prescribe the rules of living, and procure obedience to their
principles by means of rewards and punishment.</p>


<p class="parnum">147.</p>

<p><i>Paganism&mdash;Christianity.&mdash;Paganism</i> is that which says yea to all
that is natural, it is innocence in being natural, "naturalness."
<i>Christianity</i> is that which says no to all that is natural, it is a
certain lack of dignity in being natural; hostility to Nature.</p>

<p>"Innocent":&mdash;Petronius is innocent, for instance. Beside this happy
man a Christian is absolutely devoid of innocence. But since even
the <i>Christian</i> status is ultimately only a natural condition, the
term "Christian" soon begins to mean the <i>counterfeiting of the
psychological interpretation.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">148.</p>

<p>The Christian priest is from the root a mortal enemy of sensuality: one
cannot imagine a greater contrast to his attitude than the guileless,
slightly awed, and solemn attitude, which the religious rites of the
most honourable women in Athens maintained in the presence of the
symbol of s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ex. In all non-ascetic religions the procreative act is
<i>the</i> secret <i>per se</i>: a sort of symbol of perfection and of the
designs of the future: re-birth, immortality.</p>


<p class="parnum">149.</p>

<p>Our belief in ourselves is the greatest fetter, the most telling spur,
and the <i>strongest pinion.</i> Christianity ought to have elevated the
innocence of man to the position of an article of belief&mdash;men would
then have become gods: in those days believing was still possible.</p>


<p class="parnum">150.</p>

<p>The egregious <i>lie</i> of history: as if it were the <i>corruption</i> of
Paganism that opened the road to Christianity. As a matter of fact, it
was the enfeeblement and <i>moralisation</i> of the man of antiquity. The
new interpretation of natural functions, which made them appear like
<i>vices,</i> had already gone before!</p>


<p class="parnum">151.</p>

<p>Religions are ultimately wrecked by the belief in morality. The idea of
the Christian moral God becomes untenable,&mdash;hence "Atheism,"&mdash;as though
there could be no other god.</p>

<p><i>Culture</i> is likewise wrecked by the belief in morality. For when the
necessary and only possible conditions of its growth are revealed,
nobody <i>will</i> any longer countenance it (Buddhism).</p>

<p><i>The physiology of Nihilistic religions.</i>&mdash;All in all, the <i>Nihilistic</i>
religions are <i>systematised histories of sickness</i> described in
religious and moral terminology.</p>

<p>In pagan cultures it is around the interpretation of the great annual
cycles that the religious cult turns; in Christianity it is around a
cycle of <i>paralytic phenomena.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">153.</p>

<p>This <i>Nihilistic</i> religion gathers together all the <i>decadent elements</i>
and things of like order which it can find in antiquity, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>(a)</i> The <i>weak</i> and the <i>botched</i> (the refuse of the ancient world,
and that of which it rid itself with most violence).</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> Those who are <i>morally obsessed</i> and <i>anti-pagan.</i></p>

<p><i>(c)</i> Those who are <i>weary of politics</i> and indifferent (the <i>blasé</i>
Romans), the <i>denationalised,</i> who know not what they are.</p>



<p><i>(d)</i> Those who are tired of themselves&mdash;who are happy to be party to a
subterranean conspiracy.</p>


<p class="parnum">154.</p>

<p><i>Buddha</i> versus <i>Christ.</i>&mdash;Among the Nihilistic religions, Christianity
and <i>Buddhism</i> may always be sharply distinguished. <i>Buddhism</i> is the
expression of a <i>fine evening,</i> perfectly sweet and mild&mdash;it is a sort
of gratitude towards all that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>lies hidden, including that which it
entirely lacks, viz., bitterness, disillusionment, and resentment.
Finally it possesses lofty intellectual love; it has got over all
the subtlety of philosophical contradictions, and is even resting
after it, though it is precisely from that source that it derives its
intellectual glory and its glow as of a sunset (it originated in the
higher classes).</p>

<p><i>Christianity</i> is a degenerative movement, consisting of all kinds
of decaying and excremental elements: it is <i>not</i> the expression of
the downfall of a race, it is, from the root, an agglomeration of all
the morbid elements which are mutually attractive and which gravitate
to one another.... It is therefore <i>not</i> a national religion, <i>not</i>
determined by race: it appeals to the disinherited everywhere; it
consists of a foundation of resentment against all that is successful
and dominant: it is in need of a symbol which represents the damnation
of everything successful and dominant. It is opposed to every form of
<i>intellectual</i> movement, to all philosophy: it takes up the cudgels for
idiots, and utters a curse upon all intellect. Resentment against those
who are gifted, learned, intellectually independent: in all these it
suspects the element of success and domination.</p>


<p class="parnum">155.</p>

<p>In Buddhism this thought prevails: "All passions, everything which
creates emotions and leads to blood, is a call to action"&mdash;to this
extent alone are its believers <i>warned</i> against evil. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>For action has
no sense, it merely binds one to existence. All existence, however, has
no sense. Evil is interpreted as that which leads to irrationalism:
to the affirmation of means whose end is denied. A road to nonentity
is the desideratum, <i>hence all</i> emotional impulses are regarded with
horror. For instance: "On no account seek after revenge! Be the enemy
of no one!"&mdash;The Hedonism of the weary finds its highest expression
here. Nothing is more utterly foreign to Buddhism than the Jewish
fanaticism of St. Paul: nothing could be more contrary to its instinct
than the tension, fire, and unrest of the religious man, and, above
all, that form of sensuality which sanctifies Christianity with the
name "Love." Moreover, it is the cultured and very intellectual classes
who find blessedness in Buddhism: a race wearied and besotted by
centuries of philosophical quarrels, but not <i>beneath all culture</i> as
those classes were from which Christianity sprang.... In the Buddhistic
ideal, there is essentially an emancipation from good and evil: a
very subtle suggestion of a Beyond to all morality is thought out
in its teaching, and this Beyond is supposed to be compatible with
perfection,&mdash;the condition being, that even good actions are only
needed <i>pro tem.,</i> merely as a means,&mdash;that is to say, in order to be
free from <i>all</i> action.</p>


<p class="parnum">156.</p>

<p><i>How very curious</i> it is to see a <i>Nihilistic</i> religion such as
Christianity, sprung from, and in keeping with, a decrepit and worn-out
people, who have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>outlived all strong instincts, being transferred step
by step to another environment&mdash;that is to say, to a land of young
people, <i>who have not yet lived at all.</i> The joy of the final chapter,
of the fold and of the evening, preached to barbarians and Germans!
How thoroughly all of it must first have been barbarised, Germanised!
To those who had dreamed of a <i>Walhalla</i>: who found happiness only in
war!&mdash;A <i>super</i>national religion preached in the midst of chaos, where
<i>no nations yet existed even.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">157.</p>

<p>The only way to refute priests and religions is this: to show that
their errors are no longer <i>beneficent</i>&mdash;that they are rather harmful;
in short, that their own "proof of power" no longer holds good....</p>



<hr />
<p class="title">2. CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>

<p class="parnum">158.</p>

<p>Christianity as an <i>historical reality</i> should not be confounded with
that one root which its name recalls. The <i>other</i> roots, from which it
has sprung, are by far the more important. It is an unprecedented abuse
of names to identify such manifestations of decay and such abortions as
the "Christian Church," "Christian belief," and "Christian life," with
that Holy Name. What did Christ <i>deny</i>?&mdash;Everything which to-day is
called Christian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">159.</p>

<p>The whole of the Christian <i>creed</i>&mdash;all Christian "truth," is idle
falsehood and deception, and is precisely the reverse of that which was
at the bottom of the first Christian movement.</p>

<p>All that which in the <i>ecclesiastical</i> sense is Christian, is just
exactly what is most radically <i>anti-Christian</i>: crowds of things and
people appear instead of symbols, history takes the place of eternal
facts, it is all forms, rites, and dogmas instead of a "practice" of
life. To be really Christian would mean to be absolutely indifferent to
dogmas, cults, priests, church, and theology.</p>

<p>The practice of Christianity is no more an impossible phantasy than the
practice of Buddhism is: it is merely a means to happiness.</p>


<p class="parnum">160.</p>

<p>Jesus goes straight to the point, the "Kingdom of Heaven" in the heart,
and He does <i>not</i> find the means in duty to the Jewish Church; He
even regards the reality of Judaism (its need to maintain itself) as
nothing; He is concerned purely with the <i>inner</i> man.</p>

<p>Neither does He make anything of all the coarse forms relating to man's
intercourse with God: He is opposed to the whole of the teaching of
repentance and atonement; He points out how man ought to live in order
to feel himself "deified," and how futile it is on his part to hope to
live properly by showing repentance and contrition <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>for his sins. "Sin
is of no account" is practically his chief standpoint.</p>

<p>Sin, repentance, forgiveness,&mdash;all this does not belong to Christianity

<p>The teaching of rewards and punishments has become mixed up with
Christianity in a way which is quite absurd; everything is thereby

it had been <i>commanded</i> or predetermined.</p>

<p>The subsequent glorification of the actual <i>life</i> and <i>teaching</i> of the

<p>Jesus opposed a real life, a life in truth, to ordinary life: nothing

nonsense of an "eternal Peter,"&mdash;of the eternal duration of a single
person. Precisely what He combats is the exaggerated importance of the
"person": how can He wish to immortalise it?</p>

<p>He likewise combats the hierarchy within the community; He never
promises a certain proportion of reward for a certain proportion of
deserts: how can He have meant to teach the doctrine of punishment and
reward in a Beyond?</p>


<p class="parnum">167.</p>

<p>Christianity is an ingenuous attempt at bringing about a <i>Buddhistic
movement in favour of peace,</i> sprung from the very heart of the
resenting masses ... but transformed by <i>Paul</i> into a mysterious
pagan cult, which was ultimately able to accord <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>with the whole of
<i>State organisation</i> ... and which carries on war, condemns, tortures,
conjures, and hates.</p>

<p>Paul bases his teaching upon the need of mystery felt by the great
masses capable of religious emotions: he seeks a <i>victim,</i> a bloody
phantasmagoria, which may be equal to a contest with the images of
a secret cult: God on the cross, the drinking of blood, the <i>unio
mystica</i> with the "victim."</p>

<p>He seeks the prolongation of life after death (the blessed and atoned
after-life of the individual soul) which he puts in causal relation
with the <i>victim</i> already referred to (according to the type of
Dionysos, Mithras, Osiris).</p>

<p>He feels the necessity of bringing notions of <i>guilt</i> and <i>sin</i>
into the foreground, <i>not</i> a new practice of life (as Jesus Himself
demonstrated and taught), but a new cult, a new belief, a belief in a
miraculous metamorphosis ("Salvation" through belief).</p>

<p>He understood the <i>great needs of the pagan worlds</i> and he gave quite
an absolutely arbitrary picture of those two plain facts, Christ's life
and death. He gave the whole a new accent, altering the equilibrium
everywhere ... he was one of the most active destroyers of primitive
Christianity.</p>

<p>The attempt made on the life of <i>priests and theologians</i> culminated,
thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and theology&mdash;a <i>ruling</i> caste and
a <i>Church.</i></p>

<p>The attempt made to suppress the fussy importance of the "person,"
culminated in the belief in the eternal "personality" (and in the
anxiety concerning "eternal salvation" ...), and in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>most
paradoxical exaggeration of individual egoism.</p>

<p>This is the humorous side of the question&mdash;tragic humour: Paul again
set up on a large scale precisely what Jesus had overthrown by His
life. At last, when the Church edifice was complete, it even sanctioned
the <i>existence</i> of the <i>State.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">168.</p>

<p>The Church is precisely that against which Jesus inveighed&mdash;and against
which He taught His disciples to fight.</p>


<p class="parnum">169.</p>

<p>A God who died for our sins, salvation through faith, resurrection
after death&mdash;all these things are the counterfeit coins of real
Christianity, for which that pernicious blockhead Paul must be held
responsible.</p>

<p>The <i>life which must serve as an example</i> consists in love and
humility; in the abundance of hearty emotion which does not even
exclude the lowliest; in the formal renunciation of all desire of
making its rights felt; in conquest, in the sense of triumph over
oneself; in the belief in salvation in this world, despite all sorrow,
opposition, and death; in forgiveness and the absence of anger and
contempt; in the absence of a desire to be rewarded; in the refusal
to be bound to anybody; abandonment to all that is most spiritual and
intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>;&mdash;in fact, a very proud life controlled by the will of a
servile and poor life.</p>

<p>Once the Church had allowed itself to take over <i>all the Christian
practice,</i> and had formally sanctioned the State,&mdash;that kind of life
which Jesus combats and condemns,&mdash;it was obliged to lay the sense
of Christianity in other things than early Christian ideals&mdash;that is
to say, in the <i>faith</i> in incredible things, in the ceremonial of
prayers, worship, feasts, etc. etc. The notions "sin," "forgiveness,"
"punishment," "reward"&mdash;everything, in fact, which had nothing in
common with, and was quite <i>absent</i> from, primitive Christianity, now
comes into the foreground.</p>

<p>An appalling stew of Greek philosophy and Judaism; asceticism;
continual judgments and condemnations; the order of rank, etc.</p>


<p class="parnum">170.</p>

<p>Christianity has, from the first, always transformed the symbolical
into crude realities:</p>

<p>(1) The antitheses "true life" and "false life" were misunderstood and
changed into "life here" and "life beyond."</p>

<p>(2) The notion "eternal life," as opposed to the personal life which is
ephemeral, is translated into "personal immortality";</p>

<p>(3) The process of fraternising by means of sharing the same food and
drink, after the Hebrew-Arabian manner, is interpreted as the "miracle
of transubstantiation."</p>

<p>(4) "Resurrection" which was intended to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>mean the entrance to the
"true life," in the sense of being intellectually "born again," becomes
an historical contingency, supposed to take place at some moment after
death;</p>

<p>(5) The teaching of the Son of man as the "Son of God,"&mdash;that is to
say, the life-relationship between man and God,&mdash;becomes the "second
person of the Trinity," and thus the filial relationship of every
man&mdash;even the lowest&mdash;to God, is <i>done away with</i>;</p>

<p>(6) Salvation through faith (that is to say, that there is no other way
to this filial relationship to God, save through the <i>practice of life</i>
taught by Christ) becomes transformed into the belief that there is a
miraculous way of <i>atoning</i> for all <i>sin</i>; though not through our own
endeavours, but by means of Christ:</p>



<p>For all these purposes, "Christ on the Cross" had to be interpreted
afresh. The <i>death</i> itself would certainly not be the principal feature
of the event ... it was only another sign pointing to the way in
which one should behave towards the authorities and the laws of the
world&mdash;<i>that one was not to defend oneself&mdash;this was the exemplary
life.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">171.</p>

<p>Concerning the psychology of <i>Paul.</i>&mdash;The important fact is Christ's
death. This remains to be <i>explained ...</i>. That there may be truth or
error in an explanation never entered these people's heads: one day a
sublime possibility strikes them, "His death <i>might</i> mean so and so"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
&mdash;and it forthwith <i>becomes</i> so and so. An hypothesis is proved by the
sublime <i>ardour</i> it lends to its discoverer....</p>

<p>"The proof of strength": <i>i.e.,</i> a thought is demonstrated by its
<i>effects</i> ("by their fruits," as the Bible ingenuously says); that
which fires enthusiasm must be <i>true,</i>&mdash;what one loses one's blood for
must be <i>true&mdash;</i></p>

<p>In every department of this world of thought, the sudden feeling of
power which an idea imparts to him who is responsible for it, is
placed to the <i>credit</i> of that idea:&mdash;and as there seems no other way
of honouring an idea than by calling it true, the first epithet it is
honoured with is the word <i>true.</i> ... How could it have any effect
otherwise? It was imagined by some power: if that power were not
real, it could not be the cause of anything.... The thought is then
understood as <i>inspired</i>: the effect it causes has something of the
violent nature of a demoniacal influence&mdash;</p>

<p>A thought which a decadent like Paul could not resist and to which he
completely yields, is thus "proved" <i>true</i>!!!</p>

<p>All these holy epileptics and visionaries did not possess a thousandth
part of the honesty in self-criticism with which a philologist,
nowadays, reads a text, or tests the truth of an historical event....
Beside us, such people were moral cretins.</p>


<p class="parnum">172.</p>

<p>It matters little <i>whether a thing be true,</i> provided it be
<i>effective</i>: total <i>absence of intellectual uprightness.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Everything
is good, whether it be lying, slander, or shameless "cooking," provided
it serve to heighten the degree of heat to the point at which people
"believe."</p>

<p>We are face to face with an actual school for the teaching of <i>the
means wherewith</i> men are <i>seduced</i> to a belief: we see systematic
<i>contempt</i> for those spheres whence contradiction might come (that
is to say, for reason, philosophy, wisdom, doubt, and caution); a
shameless praising and glorification of the teaching, with continual
references to the fact that it was God who presented us with it&mdash;that
the apostle signifies nothing&mdash;that no criticism is brooked, but
only faith, acceptance; that it is the greatest blessing and favour
to receive such a doctrine of salvation; that the state in which one
should receive it, ought to be one of the profoundest thankfulness and
humility....</p>

<p>The resentment which the lowly feel against all those in high places,
is continually turned to account: the fact that this teaching is
revealed to them as the reverse of the wisdom of the world, against
the power of the world, seduces them to it. This teaching convinces
the outcasts and the botched of all sorts and conditions; it promises
blessedness, advantages, and privileges to the most insignificant and
most humble men; it fanaticises the poor, the small, and the foolish,
and fills them with insane vanity, as though <i>they</i> were the meaning
and salt of the earth.</p>

<p>Again, I say, all this cannot be sufficiently contemned, we spare
ourselves a criticism of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>teaching; it is sufficient to take
note of the means it uses in order to be aware of the nature of the
phenomenon one is examining. It identified itself with <i>virtue,</i>
it appropriated the whole of the <i>fascinating power of virtue,</i>
shamelessly, for its own purposes ... it availed itself of the power of
paradox, and of the need, manifested by old civilisation, for pepper
and absurdity; it amazed and revolted at the same time; it provoked
persecutions and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>It is the same kind of <i>well-thought-out meanness</i> with which the
Jewish priesthood established their power and built up their Church....</p>

<p>One must be able to discern: (1) that warmth of passion "love" (resting
on a base of ardent sensuality); (2) the thoroughly <i>ignoble character</i>
of Christianity:&mdash;the continual exaggeration and verbosity;&mdash;the lack
of cool intellectuality and irony;&mdash;the unmilitary character of all its
instincts;&mdash;the priestly prejudices against manly pride, sensuality,
the sciences, the arts.</p>


<p class="parnum">173.</p>


<p><i>Paul</i>: seeks power <i>against</i> ruling Judaism,&mdash;his attempt is too
weak.... Transvaluation of the notion "Jew": the "race" is put aside:
but that means denying the very basis of the whole structure. The
"martyr," the "fanatic," the value of all <i>strong</i> belief. Christianity
is the <i>form of decay</i> of the old world, after the latter's collapse,
and it is characterised by the fact that it brings all the most sickly
and unhealthy elements and needs to the top.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Consequently other</i> instincts had to step into the foreground, in
order to <i>constitute</i> an entity, a power able to stand alone&mdash;in short,
a condition of tense sorrow was necessary, like that out of which the
Jews had derived their <i>instinct of self-preservation....</i></p>

<p>The persecution of Christians was invaluable for this purpose.</p>

<p>Unity in the face of danger; the conversion of the masses becomes the
only means of putting an end to the persecution of the individual. (The
notion "conversion" is therefore made as elastic as possible.)</p>


<p class="parnum">174.</p>

<p>The <i>Christian Judaic</i> life: here resentment did not prevail. The
great persecutions alone could have driven out the passions to that
extent&mdash;as also the <i>ardour of love</i> and <i>hate.</i></p>

<p>When the creatures a man most loves are sacrificed before his eyes for
the sake of his faith, that man becomes <i>aggressive</i>; the triumph of
Christianity is due to its persecutors.</p>

<p><i>Asceticism</i> is not specifically Christian: this is what Schopenhauer
misunderstood. It only shoots up in Christianity, wherever it would
have existed without that religion.</p>

<p>Melancholy Christianity, the torture and torment of the conscience,
also only a peculiarity of a particular soil, where Christian values
have taken root: it is not Christianity properly speaking. Christianity
has absorbed all the different kinds of diseases which grow from morbid
soil: one could <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>refute it at one blow by showing that it did not know
how to resist any contagion. But <i>that</i> precisely is the essential
feature of it. Christianity is a type of decadence.</p>


<p class="parnum">175.</p>

<p>The reality on which Christianity was able to build up its power
consisted of the small dispersed <i>Jewish families,</i> with their warmth,
tenderness, and peculiar readiness to help, which, to the whole of the
Roman Empire, was perhaps the most incomprehensible and least familiar
of their characteristics; they were also united by their pride at
being a "chosen people," concealed beneath a cloak of humility, and by
their secret denial of all that was uppermost and that possessed power
and splendour, although there was no shade of envy in their denial.
<i>To have recognised this as a power,</i> to have regarded this <i>blessed</i>
state as communicable, seductive, and infectious even where pagans
were concerned&mdash;this constituted Paul's genius: to use up the treasure
of latent energy and cautious happiness for the purposes of "a Jewish
Church of free confession," and to avail himself of all the Jewish
experience, their propaganda, and their expertness in <i>the preservation
of a community</i> under a foreign power&mdash;this is what he conceived to
be his duty. He it was who discovered that absolutely unpolitical and
isolated body of <i>paltry people,</i> and their art of asserting themselves
and pushing themselves to the front, by means of a host of acquired
virtues which are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>made to represent the only forms of virtue ("the
self-preservative measure and weapon of success of a certain class of
man").</p>

<p>The principle of <i>love</i> comes from the small community of Jewish
people: a <i>very passionate</i> soul glows here, beneath the ashes of
humility and wretchedness: it is neither Greek, Indian, nor German. The
song in praise of love which Paul wrote is not Christian; it is the
Jewish flare of that eternal flame which is Semitic. If Christianity
has done anything essentially new in a psychological sense, it is this,
that it has <i>increased the temperature of the soul</i> among those cooler
and more noble races who were at one time at the head of affairs;
it discovered that the most wretched life could be made rich and
invaluable, by means of an elevation of the temperature of the soul....</p>

<p>It is easily understood that a transfer of this sort could <i>not</i>
take place among the ruling classes: the Jews and Christians were at
a disadvantage owing to their bad manners&mdash;spiritual strength and
passion, when accompanied by bad manners, only provoke loathing (I
become aware of these bad manners while reading the New Testament). It
was necessary to be related both in baseness and sorrow with this type
of lower manhood in order to feel anything attractive in him.... The
attitude a man maintains towards the New Testament is a test of the
amount of taste he may have for the classics (see Tacitus); he who is
not revolted by it, he who does not feel honestly and deeply that he is
in the presence of a sort of <i>fœda superstitio</i> when reading it, and
who does not draw <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>his hand back so as not to soil his fingers&mdash;such a
man does not know what is classical. A man must feel about "the cross"
as Goethe did.<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><i>The reaction of paltry people</i>:&mdash;Love provides the feeling of highest
power. It should be understood to what extent, not man in general, but
only a certain kind of man is speaking here.</p>

<p>"We are godly in love, we shall be 'the children of God'; God loves us
and wants nothing from us save love"; that is to say: all morality,
obedience, and action, do not produce the same feeling of power and
freedom as love does;&mdash;a man does nothing wicked from sheer love, but
he does much more than if he were prompted by obedience and virtue
alone.</p>

<p>Here is the happiness of the herd, the communal feeling in big things
as in small, the living sentiment of unity felt as the <i>sum of the
feeling of life.</i> Helping, caring for, and being useful, constantly
kindle the feeling of power; visible success, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>expression of
pleasure, emphasise the feeling of power; pride is not lacking either,
it is felt in the form of the community, the House of God, and the
"chosen people."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, man has once more experienced an "<i>altération" of
his personality</i>: this time he called his feeling of love&mdash;God. The
awakening of such a feeling must be pictured; it is a sort of ecstasy,
a strange language, a "Gospel"&mdash;it was this newness which did not
allow man to attribute love to himself&mdash;he thought it was God leading
him on and taking shape in his heart. "God descends among men," one's
neighbour is transfigured and becomes a God (in so far as he provokes
the sentiment of love), <i>Jesus is the neighbour,</i> the moment He is
transfigured in thought into a God, and into a cause <i>provoking the
feeling of power.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">177.</p>

<p>Believers are aware that they owe an infinite amount to Christianity,
and therefore conclude that its Founder must have been a man of the
first rank.... This conclusion is false, but it is typical of the
reverents. Regarded objectively, it is, <i>in the first place,</i> just
possible that they are mistaken concerning the extent of their debt to
Christianity: a man's convictions prove nothing concerning the thing
he is convinced about, and in religions they are more likely to give
rise to suspicions.... Secondly, it is possible that the debt owing
to Christianity is not due to its Founder at all, but to the whole
structure, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>whole thing&mdash;to the Church, etc. The notion "Founder"
is so very equivocal, that it may stand even for the accidental
cause of a movement: the person of the Founder has been inflated in
proportion as the Church has grown: but even this process of veneration
allows of the conclusion that, at one time or other, this Founder was
something exceedingly insecure and doubtful&mdash;in the beginning.... Let
any one think of the <i>free and easy way</i> in which Paul treats the
problem of the personality of Jesus, how he almost juggles with it:
some one who died, who was seen after His death,&mdash;some one whom the
Jews delivered up to death&mdash;all this was only the theme&mdash;<i>Paul</i> wrote
the music to it.</p>


<p class="parnum">178.</p>

<p>The founder of a religion <i>may</i> be quite insignificant&mdash;a wax vesta and
no <i>more</i>!</p>


<p class="parnum">179.</p>

<p><i>Concerning the psychological problem of Christianity.&mdash;The driving
forces are</i>: resentment, popular insurrection, the revolt of the
bungled and the botched. (In Buddhism it is different: it is not <i>born</i>
of <i>resentment.</i> It rather combats resentment because the latter leads
to <i>action</i>!)</p>

<p>This party, which stands for freedom, understands that the <i>abandonment
of antagonism in thought and deed</i> is a condition of distinction and
preservation. Here lies the psychological difficulty which has stood in
the way of Christianity being <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>understood: the force which created it,
urges to a struggle against itself.</p>

<p>Only as a party standing <i>for peace</i> and <i>innocence</i> can this
insurrectionary movement hope to be successful: it must conquer by
means of excessive mildness, sweetness, softness, and its instincts
are aware of this. The <i>feat</i> was to deny and condemn the force, of
which man is the expression, and to press the reverse of that force
continually to the fore, by word and deed.</p>


<p class="parnum">180.</p>

<p><i>The pretence of youthfulness.</i>&mdash;It is a mistake to imagine that,
with Christianity, an ingenuous and youthful people rose against an
old culture; the story goes that it was out of the lowest levels of
society, where Christianity flourished and shot its roots, that the
more profound source of life gushed forth afresh: but nothing can
be understood of the psychology of Christianity, if it be supposed
that it was the expression of revived youth among a people, or of
the resuscitated strength of a race. It is rather a typical form
of decadence, of moral-softening and of hysteria, amid a general
hotch-potch of races and people that had lost all aims and had grown
weary and sick. The wonderful company which gathered round this
master-seducer of the populace, would not be at all out of place in a
Russian novel: all the diseases of the nerves seem to give one another
a rendezvous in this crowd&mdash;the absence of a known duty, the feeling
that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>everything is nearing its end, that nothing is any longer worth
while, and that contentment lies in <i>dolce far niente</i>.</p>

<p>The power and certainty of the future in the Jew's instinct, its
monstrous will for life and for power, lies in its ruling classes; the
people who upheld primitive Christianity are best distinguished by this
<i>exhausted condition</i> of their instincts. On the one hand, they are
sick of everything; on the other, they are content with each other,
with themselves and for themselves.</p>


<p class="parnum">181.</p>

<p>Christianity regarded as <i>emancipated Judaism</i> (just as a nobility
which is both racial and indigenous ultimately emancipates itself from
these conditions, and <i>goes in search of</i> kindred elements....).</p>

<p>(1) As a Church (community) on the territory of the State, as an
unpolitical institution.</p>

<p>(2) As life, breeding, practice, art of living.</p>

<p>(3) As a <i>religion of sin</i> (sin committed against <i>God, being the
only recognised kind,</i> and the only cause of all suffering), with a
universal cure for it. There is no sin save against God; what is done
against men, man shall not sit in judgment upon, nor call to account,
except in the name of God. At the same time, all commandments (love):
everything is associated with God, and all acts are performed according
to God's will. Beneath this arrangement there lies exceptional
intelligence (a very narrow life, such as that led by the Esquimaux,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
can only be endured by most peaceful and indulgent people: the
Judæo-Christian dogma turns against sin in favour of the "sinner").</p>


<p class="parnum">182.</p>

<p>The Jewish priesthood understood how to present everything it claimed
to be right as a <i>divine precept,</i> as an act of obedience to God, and
also to introduce all those things which conduced to <i>preserve Israel</i>
and were the <i>conditions</i> of its existence (for instance: the large
number of "<i>works</i>": circumcision and the cult of sacrifices, as the
very pivot of the national conscience), not as Nature, but as God.</p>

<p><i>This process continued; within the very heart</i> of Judaism, where the
need of these "works" was not felt (that is to say, as a means of
keeping a race distinct), a priestly sort of man was pictured, whose
bearing towards the aristocracy was like that of "noble nature"; a
sacerdotalism of the soul, which now, in order to throw its opposite
into strong relief, attaches value, not to the "dutiful acts"
themselves, but to the sentiment....</p>

<p>At bottom, the problem was once again, how to make a certain kind of
soul <i>prevail</i>: it was also <i>a popular insurrection in the midst of
a priestly people</i>&mdash;a pietistic movement coming from below (sinners,
publicans, women, and children). Jesus of Nazareth was the symbol of
their sect. And again, in order to believe in themselves, they were in
need of a <i>theological transfiguration</i>: they require nothing less than
"the Son of God" in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>order to create a belief for themselves. And just
as the priesthood had falsified the whole history of Israel, another
attempt was made, here, to <i>alter and falsify</i> the whole history of
mankind in such a way as to make Christianity seem like the most
important event it contained. This movement could have originated only
upon the soil of Judaism, the main feature of which was the confounding
of <i>guilt with sorrow</i> and the reduction of all <i>sin</i> to <i>sin against
God.</i> Of all this, Christianity is the <i>second degree of power.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">183.</p>

<p>The symbolism of Christianity is based upon that of <i>Judaism,</i> which
had already transfigured all reality (history, Nature) into a holy and
artificial unreality&mdash;which refused to recognise real history, and
which showed no more interest in a natural course of things.</p>


<p class="parnum">184.</p>

<p>The Jews made the attempt to prevail, after two of their castes&mdash;the
warrior and the agricultural castes, had disappeared from their midst.</p>

<p>In this sense they are the "castrated people": they have their priests
and then&mdash;their Chandala....</p>

<p>How easily a disturbance occurs among them&mdash;an insurrection of their
Chandala. This was the origin of <i>Christianity.</i></p>

<p>Owing to the fact that they had no knowledge of warriors except as
their masters, they introduced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>enmity towards the nobles, the men
of honour, pride, and power, and the <i>ruling</i> classes, into their
religion: they are pessimists from <i>indignation....</i></p>

<p>Thus they created a very important and novel position: the priests in
the van of the Chandala&mdash;against the <i>noble classes....</i></p>

<p>Christianity was the logical conclusion of this movement: even in the
Jewish priesthood, it still scented the existence of the caste, of the
privileged and noble minority&mdash;<i>it therefore did away with priests.</i></p>

<p>Christ is the unit of the Chandala who removes the priest ... the
Chandala who redeems himself....</p>

<p>That is why the <i>French</i> Revolution is the lineal descendant and the
continuator of <i>Christianity&mdash;</i> it is characterised by an instinct of
hate towards castes, nobles, and the last privileges.</p>


<p class="parnum">185.</p>

<p>The "<i>Christian Ideal</i>" put on the stage with Jewish astuteness&mdash;these
are the fundamental <i>psychological forces</i> of its "nature":&mdash;</p>

<p>Revolt against the ruling spiritual powers;</p>

<p>The attempt to make those virtues which facilitate the <i>happiness of
the lowly,</i> a standard of all values&mdash;in fact, to call <i>God</i> that which
is no more than the self-preservative instinct of that class of man
possessed of least vitality;</p>

<p>Obedience and absolute <i>abstention</i> from war and resistance, justified
by this ideal;</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
The love of one another as a result of the love of God.</p>

<p><i>The trick</i>: The <i>denial</i> of all <i>natural mobilia,</i> and their
transference to the spiritual world beyond ... the exploitation of
<i>virtue</i> and its <i>veneration</i> for wholly interested motives, gradual
<i>denial</i> of virtue in everything that is not Christian.</p>


<p class="parnum">186.</p>

<p>The <i>profound contempt</i> with which the Christian was treated by
the noble people of antiquity, is of the same order as the present
instinctive aversion to Jews: it is the hatred which free and
self-respecting classes feel towards those <i>who wish to creep
in secretly,</i> and who combine an awkward bearing with foolish
self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>The New Testament is the gospel of a completely <i>ignoble</i> species of
man; its pretensions to highest values&mdash;<i>yea, to all</i> values, is, as a
matter of fact, revolting&mdash;even nowadays.</p>


<p class="parnum">187.</p>

<p>How little the subject matters! It is the spirit which gives the thing
life! What a quantity of stuffy and sick-room air there is in all that
chatter about "redemption," "love," "blessedness," "faith," "truth,"
"eternal life"! Let any one look into a really pagan book and compare
the two; for instance, in Petronius, nothing at all is done, said,
desired, and valued, which, according to a bigoted Christian estimate,
is not sin, or even deadly sin. And yet how happy one feels with the
purer air, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>superior intellectuality, the quicker pace, and the
free overflowing strength which is certain of the future! In the whole
of the New Testament there is not one <i>bouffonnerie</i>: but that fact
alone would suffice to refute any book....</p>


<p class="parnum">188.</p>

<p>The <i>profound lack of dignity</i> with which all life, which is not
Christian, is condemned: it does not suffice them to think meanly of
their actual opponents, they cannot do with less than a general slander
of everything that is not <i>themselves....</i> An abject and crafty soul is
in the most perfect harmony with the arrogance of piety, as witness the
early Christians.</p>

<p>The <i>future</i>: they see that <i>they are heavily paid for it.... Theirs is
the muddiest kind of spirit that exists.</i> The whole of Christ's life is
so arranged as to confirm the prophecies of the Scriptures: He behaves
in such wise <i>in order that</i> they may be right....</p>


<p class="parnum">189.</p>

<p>The deceptive interpretation of the words, the doings, and the
condition of <i>dying people</i>; the natural fear of death, for instance,
is systematically confounded with the supposed fear of what is to
happen "after death." ...</p>


<p class="parnum">190.</p>

<p>The <i>Christians</i> have done exactly what the Jews did before them.
They introduced what they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>conceived to be an innovation and a thing
necessary to self-preservation into their Master's teaching, and wove
His life into it They likewise credited Him with all the wisdom of a
maker of proverbs&mdash;<i>in short,</i> they represented their everyday life and
activity as an act of obedience, and thus sanctified their propaganda.</p>

<p>What it all depends upon, may be gathered from Paul: it is <i>not much.</i>
What remains is the development of a type of saint, out of the values
which these people regarded as saintly.</p>

<p>The whole of the "doctrine of miracles," including the resurrection, is
the result of self-glorification on the part of the community, which
ascribed to its Master those qualities it ascribed to itself, but in a
higher degree (or, better still, it derived its strength from Him....)</p>


<p class="parnum">191.</p>

<p>The Christians have never led the life which Jesus commanded them to
lead, and the impudent fable of the "justification by faith," and its
unique and transcendental significance, is only the result of the
Church's lack of courage and will in acknowledging those "<i>works</i>"
which Jesus commanded.</p>

<p>The Buddhist behaves differently from the non-Buddhist; but <i>the
Christian behaves as all the rest of the world does,</i> and possesses a
Christianity of ceremonies and <i>states of the soul.</i></p>

<p>The profound and contemptible falsehood of Christianity in Europe makes
us deserve the contempt of the Arabs, Hindoos, and Chinese....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Let any one listen to the words of the first German statesman,
concerning that which has preoccupied Europe for the last forty years.</p>


<p class="parnum">192.</p>

<p>"<i>Faith</i>" or "<i>works</i>"?&mdash;But that the "works," the habit of particular
works may engender a certain <i>set of values or thoughts,</i> is just as
natural as it would be unnatural for "works" to proceed from mere
valuations. Man must practise, <i>not</i> how to strengthen feelings of
value, but how to strengthen action: first of all, one must be able
<i>to do something....</i> Luther's Christian Dilettantism. Faith is an
asses' bridge. The background consists of a profound conviction on
the part of Luther and his peers, that they are enabled to accomplish
Christian "works," a personal fact, disguised under an extreme doubt
as to whether <i>all</i> action is not sin and devil's work, so that the
worth of life depends upon isolated and highly-strained conditions of
<i>inactivity</i> (prayer, effusion, etc.).&mdash;Ultimately, Luther would be
right: the instincts which are expressed by the whole bearing of the
reformers are the most brutal that exist. Only in <i>turning absolutely
away</i> from themselves, and in becoming absorbed in the <i>opposite</i> of
themselves, only by means of an <i>illusion</i> ("faith") was existence
endurable to them.</p>


<p class="parnum">193.</p>

<p>"What was to be done in order to believe?"&mdash;an absurd question. That
which is wrong with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Christianity is, that it does none of the things
that Christ <i>commanded.</i></p>

<p>It is a mean life, but <i>seen</i> through the eye of contempt.</p>


<p class="parnum">194.</p>

<p>The entrance into the <i>real</i> life&mdash;<i>a man saves his own life by living
the life of the multitude.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">195.</p>

<p>Christianity has become something fundamentally different from what
its Founder wished it to be. It is the great <i>anti-pagan movement</i> of
antiquity, formulated with the use of the life, teaching, and "words"
of the Founder of Christianity, but interpreted quite <i>arbitrarily,</i>
according to a scheme embodying <i>profoundly different needs</i>:
translated into the language of all the <i>subterranean religions</i> then
existing.</p>

<p>It is the rise of Pessimism (whereas Jesus wished to bring the peace
and the happiness of the lambs): and moreover the Pessimism of the
weak, of the inferior, of the suffering, and of the oppressed.</p>

<p>Its mortal enemies are (1) <i>Power,</i> whether in the form of character,
intellect, or taste, and "worldliness"; (2) the "good cheer" of
classical times, the noble levity and scepticism, hard pride, eccentric
dissipation, and cold frugality of the sage, Greek refinement in
manners, words, and form. Its mortal enemy is as much the <i>Roman</i> as
the <i>Greek.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The attempt on the part of <i>anti-paganism</i> to establish itself on
a philosophical basis, and to make its tenets possible: it shows a
taste for the ambiguous figures of antique culture, and above all for
Plato, who was, more than any other, an anti-Hellene and Semite in
instinct.... It also shows a taste for Stoicism, which is essentially
the work of Semites ("dignity" is regarded as severity, law; virtue
is held to be greatness, self-responsibility, authority, greatest
sovereignty over oneself&mdash;this is Semitic.) The Stoic is an Arabian
sheik wrapped in Greek togas and notions.</p>


<p class="parnum">196.</p>

<p>Christianity only resumes the fight which had already been begun
against the <i>classical</i> ideal and <i>noble</i> religion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the whole process of <i>transformation</i> is only
an adaptation to the needs and to the level of intelligence of
<i>religious</i> masses then existing:&mdash;those masses which believed in
Isis, Mithras, Dionysos, and the "great mother," and which demanded
the following things of a religion: (1) hopes of a beyond, (2) the
bloody phantasmagoria of animal sacrifice (the mystery), (3) holy
legend and the redeeming <i>deed,</i> (4) asceticism, denial of the
world, superstitious "purification," (5) a hierarchy as a part of
the community. In short, Christianity everywhere fitted the already
prevailing and increasing <i>anti-pagan tendency</i>&mdash;those cults which
Epicurus combated,&mdash;or more exactly, those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><i>religions proper to the
lower herd, women, slaves, and ignoble classes.</i></p>

<p>The misunderstandings are therefore the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The immortality of the individual;</p>

<p>(2) The assumed existence of <i>another</i> world;</p>

<p>(3) The absurd notion of punishment and expiation in the heart of the
interpretation of existence;</p>

<p>(4) The profanation of the divine nature of man, instead of its
accentuation, and the construction of a very profound chasm, which
can only be crossed by the help of a miracle or by means of the most
thorough self-contempt;</p>

<p>(5) The whole world of corrupted imagination and morbid passion,
instead of a simple and loving life of action, instead of Buddhistic
happiness attainable on earth;</p>

<p>(6) An ecclesiastical order with a priesthood, theology, cults, and
sacraments; in short, everything that Jesus of Nazareth <i>combated</i>;</p>

<p>(7) The <i>miraculous</i> in everything and everybody, superstition too:
while precisely the trait which distinguished Judaism and primitive
Christianity was their <i>repugnance to</i> miracles and their relative
<i>rationalism.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">197.</p>

<p><i>The psychological pre-requisites:&mdash;Ignorance</i> and <i>lack of
culture,</i>&mdash;the sort of ignorance which has unlearned every kind of
shame: let any one imagine those impudent saints in the heart of
Athens;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
The <i>Jewish instinct of a chosen people</i>: they appropriate <i>all the
virtues,</i> without further ado, as their own, and regard the rest of
the world as their opposite; this is a profound sign of <i>spiritual
depravity</i>;</p>

<p><i>The total lack of real aims</i> and real <i>duties,</i> for which other
virtues are required than those of the bigot&mdash;<i>the State undertook
this work for them</i>: and the impudent people still behaved as though
they had no need of the State. "Except ye become as little children"
&mdash;oh, how far we are from this psychological ingenuousness!</p>


<p class="parnum">198.</p>

<p>The Founder of Christianity had to pay dearly for having directed His
teaching at the lowest classes of Jewish society and intelligence. They
understood Him only according to the limitations of their own spirit.
... It was a disgrace to concoct a history of salvation, a personal
God, a personal Saviour, a personal immortality, and to have retained
all the meanness of the "person," and of the "history" of a doctrine
which denies the reality of all that is personal and historical.</p>

<p>The legend of salvation takes the place of the symbolic "now" and "all
time," of the symbolic "here" and "everywhere"; and miracles appear
instead of the psychological symbol.</p>


<p class="parnum">199.</p>

<p>Nothing is less innocent than the New Testament. The soil from which it
sprang is known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
These people, possessed of an inflexible will to assert themselves, and
who, once they had lost all natural hold on life, and had long existed
without any right to existence, still knew how to prevail by means of
hypotheses which were as unnatural as they were imaginary (calling
themselves the chosen people, the community of saints, the people of
the promised land, and the "Church"): these people made use of their
<i>pia fraus</i> with such skill, and with such "clean consciences," that
one cannot be too cautious when they preach morality. When Jews step
forward as the personification of innocence, the danger must be great.
While reading the New Testament a man should have his small fund of
intelligence, mistrust, and wickedness constantly at hand.</p>

<p>People of the lowest origin, partly mob, outcasts not only from good
society, but also from respectable society; grown away from the
<i>atmosphere</i> of culture, and free from discipline; ignorant, without
even a suspicion of the fact that conscience can also rule in spiritual
matters; in a word&mdash;the Jews: an instinctively crafty people, able to
create an advantage, a means of <i>seduction</i> out of every conceivable
hypothesis of superstition, even out of ignorance itself.</p>


<p class="parnum">200.</p>

<p>I regard Christianity as the most fatal and seductive lie that has ever
yet existed&mdash;as the greatest and most <i>impious lie</i>: I can discern the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>last sprouts and branches of its ideal beneath every form of disguise,
I decline to enter into any compromise or false position in reference
to it&mdash;I urge people to declare open war with it.</p>

<p>The <i>morality of paltry people</i> as the measure of all things: this is
the most repugnant kind of degeneracy that civilisation has ever yet
brought into existence. And this <i>kind of ideal</i> is hanging still,
under the name of "God," over men's heads!!</p>


<p class="parnum">201.</p>

<p>However modest one's demands may be concerning intellectual
cleanliness, when one touches the New Testament one cannot help
experiencing a sort of inexpressible feeling of discomfort; for the
unbounded cheek with which the least qualified people will have their
say in its pages, in regard to the greatest problems of existence,
and claim to sit in judgment on such matters, exceeds all limits. The
impudent levity with which the most unwieldy problems are spoken of
here (life, the world, God, the purpose of life), as if they were not
problems at all, but the most simple things which these little bigots
<i>know all about</i>!!!</p>


<p class="parnum">202.</p>

<p>This was the most fatal form of insanity that has ever yet existed on
earth:&mdash;when these little lying abortions of bigotry begin laying claim
to the words "God," "last judgment," "truth," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"love," "wisdom," "Holy
Spirit," and thereby distinguishing themselves from the rest of the
world; when such men begin to transvalue values to suit themselves, as
though they were the sense, the salt, the standard, and the measure of
all things; then all that one should do is this: build lunatic asylums
for their incarceration. To <i>persecute</i> them was an egregious act of
antique folly: this was taking them too seriously; it was making them
serious.</p>

<p>The whole fatality was made possible by the fact that a similar form
of megalomania was already <i>in existence,</i> the <i>Jewish</i> form (once
the gulf separating the Jews from the Christian-Jews was bridged, the
Christian-Jews <i>were compelled</i> to employ those self-preservative
measures afresh which were discovered by the Jewish instinct, for
their own self-preservation, after having accentuated them); and again
through the fact that Greek moral philosophy had done everything that
could be done to prepare the way for moral-fanaticism, even among
Greeks and Romans, and to render it palatable.... Plato, the great
importer of corruption, who was the first who refused to see Nature
in morality, and who had already deprived the Greek gods of all their
worth by his notion "<i>good</i>" was already tainted with <i>Jewish bigotry</i>
(in Egypt?).</p>


<p class="parnum">203.</p>

<p>These small virtues of gregarious animals do not by any means lead
to "eternal life": to put <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>them on the stage in such a way, and to
use them for one's own purpose is perhaps very smart; but to him who
keeps his eyes open, even here, it remains, in spite of all, the most
ludicrous performance. A man by no means deserves privileges, either on
earth or in heaven, because he happens to have attained to perfection
in the art of behaving like a good-natured little sheep; at best, he
only remains a dear, absurd little ram with horns&mdash;provided, of course,
he does not burst with vanity or excite indignation by assuming the
airs of a supreme judge.</p>

<p>What a terrible glow of false colouring here floods the meanest
virtues&mdash;as though they were the reflection of divine qualities!</p>

<p>The <i>natural</i> purpose and utility of every virtue is systematically
<i>hushed up</i>; it can only be valuable in the light of a <i>divine</i> command
or model, or in the light of the good which belongs to a beyond or a
spiritual world. (This is magnificent!&mdash;As if it were a question of the
<i>salvation of the soul</i>: but it was a means of making things bearable
here with as many beautiful sentiments as possible.)</p>


<p class="parnum">204.</p>

<p>The <i>law,</i> which is the fundamentally realistic formula of certain
self-preservative measures of a community, forbids certain actions
that have a definite tendency to jeopardise the welfare of that
community: it does <i>not</i> forbid the attitude of mind which gives rise
to these actions&mdash;for in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>pursuit of other ends the community
requires these forbidden actions, namely, when it is a matter of
opposing its <i>enemies.</i> The moral idealist now steps forward and says:
"God sees into men's hearts: the action itself counts for nothing;
the reprehensible attitude of mind from which it proceeds must be
extirpated ..." In normal conditions men laugh at such things; it is
only in exceptional cases, when a community lives <i>quite</i> beyond the
need of waging war in order to maintain itself, that an ear is lent to
such things. Any attitude of mind is abandoned, the utility of which
cannot be conceived.</p>

<p>This was the case, for example, when Buddha appeared among a people
that was both peaceable and afflicted with great intellectual weariness.</p>

<p>This was also the case in regard to the first Christian community (as
also the Jewish), the primary condition of which was the absolutely
<i>unpolitical</i> Jewish society. Christianity could grow only upon the
soil of Judaism&mdash;that is to say, among a people that had already
renounced the political life, and which led a sort of parasitic
existence within the Roman sphere of government, Christianity goes a
step <i>farther</i>: it allows men to "emasculate" themselves even more; the
circumstances actually favour their doing so.&mdash;<i>Nature</i> is <i>expelled</i>
from morality when it is said, "Love ye your enemies": for <i>Nature's</i>
injunction, "Ye shall <i>love</i> your neighbour and <i>hate</i> your enemy,"
has now become senseless in the law (in instinct); now, even <i>the love
a man feels for his neighbour</i> must first be based upon something (<i>a
sort of love <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>of God</i>). <i>God</i> is introduced everywhere, and <i>utility</i>
is withdrawn; the natural <i>origin</i> of morality is denied everywhere:
the <i>veneration of Nature,</i> which lies in <i>acknowledging a natural
morality,</i> is <i>destroyed</i> to the roots....</p>

<p>Whence comes the <i>seductive charm</i> of this emasculate ideal of man? Why
are we not <i>disgusted</i> by it, just as we are disgusted at the thought
of a eunuch?... The answer is obvious: it is not the voice of the
eunuch that revolts us, despite the cruel mutilation of which it is the
result; for, as a matter of fact, it has grown sweeter.... And owing to
the very fact that the "male organ" has been amputated from virtue, its
voice now has a feminine ring, which, formerly, was not to be discerned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have only to think of the terrible hardness,
dangers, and accidents to which a life of manly virtues leads&mdash;the
life of a Corsican, even at the present day, or that of a heathen Arab
(which resembles the Corsican's life even to the smallest detail:
the Arab's songs might have been written by Corsicans)&mdash;in order to
perceive how the most robust type of man was fascinated and moved by
the voluptuous ring of this "goodness" and "purity." ... A pastoral
melody ... an idyll ... the "good man": such things have most effect in
ages when tragedy is abroad.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>With this, we have realised to what extent the "idealist" (the ideal
eunuch) also proceeds from a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>definite reality and is not merely a
visionary.... He has perceived precisely that, for his kind of reality,
a brutal injunction of the sort which prohibits certain actions has no
sense (because the instinct which would urge him to these actions is
<i>weakened,</i> thanks to a long need of practice, and of compulsion to
practise). The castrator formulates a host of new self-preservative
measures for a perfectly definite species of men: in this sense he is
a realist. The <i>means</i> to which he has recourse for establishing his
legislation, are the same as those of ancient legislators: he appeals
to all authorities, to "God," and he exploits the notions "guilt and
punishment"&mdash;that is to say, he avails himself of the whole of the
older ideal, but interprets it differently; for instance: punishment is
given a place in the inner self (it is called the pang of conscience).</p>

<p>In practice this kind of man <i>meets with his end</i> the moment the
exceptional conditions favouring his existence cease to prevail&mdash;a sort
of insular happiness, like that of Tahiti, and of the little Jews in
the Roman provinces. Their only <i>natural</i> foe is the soil from which
they spring: they must wage war against that, and once more give their
<i>offensive</i> and <i>defensive</i> passions rope in order to be equal to
it: their opponents are the adherents of the old ideal (this kind of
hostility is shown on a grand scale by Paul in relation to Judaism, and
by Luther in relation to the priestly ascetic ideal). The mildest form
of this antagonism is certainly that of the first Buddhists; perhaps
nothing has given rise to so much work, as the enfeeblement and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
discouragement of the feeling of <i>antagonism.</i> The struggle against
resentment almost seems the Buddhist's first duty; thus only is his
<i>peace</i> of soul secured. To isolate oneself without bitterness, this
presupposes the existence of a surprisingly mild and sweet order of
men,&mdash;saints....</p>

<p>The <i>Astuteness of moral castration.</i>&mdash;How is war waged against
the virile passions and valuations? No violent physical means are
available; the war must therefore be one of ruses, spells, and lies&mdash;in
short, a "spiritual war."</p>

<p>First recipe: One appropriates virtue in general, and makes it the main
feature of one's ideal; the older ideal is denied and declared to be
<i>the reverse of all ideals.</i> Slander has to be carried to a fine art
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Second recipe: A type of man is set up as a general <i>standard</i>; and
this is projected into all things, behind all things, and behind the
destiny of all things&mdash;as God.</p>

<p>Third recipe: The opponents of one's ideal are declared to be the
opponents of God; one arrogates to oneself a <i>right</i> to great pathos,
to power, and a right to curse and to bless.</p>

<p>Fourth recipe: All suffering, all gruesome, terrible, and fatal things
are declared to be the results of opposition to <i>ones</i> ideal&mdash;all
suffering is <i>punishment</i> even in the case of one's adherents (except
it be a trial, etc.).</p>

<p>Fifth recipe: One goes so far as to regard Nature as the reverse of
one's ideal, and the lengthy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>sojourn amid natural conditions is
considered a great trial of patience&mdash;a sort of martyrdom; one studies
contempt, both in one's attitudes and one's looks towards all "natural
things."</p>

<p>Sixth recipe: The triumph of anti-naturalism and ideal castration,
the triumph of the world of the pure, good, sinless, and blessed, is
projected into the future as the consummation, the finale, the great
hope, and the "Coming of the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p>I hope that one may still be allowed to <i>laugh</i> at this artificial
hoisting up of a small species of man to the position of an absolute
standard of all things?</p>


<p class="parnum">205.</p>

<p>What I do not at all like in Jesus of Nazareth and His Apostle Paul,
is that they <i>stuffed so much into the heads of paltry people,</i> as
if their modest virtues were worth so much ado. We have had to pay
dearly for it all; for they brought the most valuable qualities of both
virtue and man into ill repute; they set the guilty conscience and the
self-respect of noble souls at loggerheads, and they led the <i>braver,
more magnanimous, more daring, and more excessive</i> tendencies of strong
souls astray&mdash;even to self-destruction.</p>


<p class="parnum">206.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, and especially in the Gospels, I discern
absolutely no sign of a "<i>Divine</i>" voice: but rather an <i>indirect
form</i> of the most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>subterranean fury, both in slander and
destructiveness&mdash;one of the most dishonest forms of hatred. It lacks
<i>all</i> knowledge of the qualities of a <i>higher nature.</i> It makes an
impudent abuse of all kinds of plausibilities, and the whole stock of
proverbs is used up and foisted upon one in its pages. Was it necessary
to make a <i>God</i> come in order to appeal to those publicans and to say
to them, etc. etc.?</p>

<p>Nothing could be more vulgar than this struggle with the <i>Pharisees,</i>
carried on with a host of absurd and unpractical moral pretences; the
mob, of course, has always been entertained by such feats. Fancy the
reproach of "hypocrisy!" coming from those lips! Nothing could be more
vulgar than this treatment of one's opponents&mdash;a most insidious sign of
nobility or its <i>reverse....</i></p>


<p class="parnum">207.</p>

<p>Primitive Christianity is the <i>abolition</i> of the <i>State</i>: it prohibits
oaths, military service, courts of justice, self-defence or the defence
of a community, and denies the difference between fellow-countrymen and
strangers, as also the <i>order of castes.</i></p>

<p><i>Christs example</i>; He does not withstand those who ill-treat Him; He
does not defend Himself; He does more, He "offers the left cheek"
(to the demand: "Tell us whether thou be the Christ?" He replies:
"Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven"). He forbids His disciples
to defend Him; He calls attention to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>the fact that He could get help
if He wished to, but <i>will</i> not.</p>

<p>Christianity also means the <i>abolition of society,</i> it prizes
everything that society despises, its very growth takes place among the
outcasts, the condemned, and the leprous of all kinds, as also among
"publicans," "sinners," prostitutes, and the most foolish of men (the
"fisher folk "); it despises the rich, the scholarly, the noble, the
virtuous, and the "punctilious." ...</p>


<p class="parnum">208.</p>

<p>The war against the noble and the powerful, as it is waged in the New
Testament, is reminiscent of Reynard the Fox and his methods: but
<i>plus</i> the Christian unction and the more absolute refusal to recognise
one's own craftiness.</p>


<p class="parnum">209.</p>

<p>The Gospel is the announcement that the road to happiness lies open for
the lowly and the poor&mdash;that all one has to do is to emancipate one's
self from all institutions, traditions, and the tutelage of the higher
classes. Thus Christianity is no more than the <i>typical teaching of
Socialists.</i></p>

<p>Property, acquisitions, mother-country, status and rank, tribunals,
the police, the State, the Church, Education, Art, militarism: all
these are so many obstacles in the way of happiness, so many mistakes,
snares, and devil's artifices, on which the Gospel passes sentence&mdash;all
this is typical of socialistic doctrines.</p>

<p>Behind all this there is the outburst, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>explosion, of a
concentrated loathing of the "masters,"&mdash;the instinct which discerns
the happiness of freedom after such long oppression.... (Mostly a
symptom of the fact that the inferior classes have been treated too
humanely, that their tongues already taste a joy which is forbidden
them.... It is not hunger that provokes revolutions, but the fact that
the mob have contracted an appetite <i>en mangeant....</i>)</p>


<p class="parnum">210.</p>

<p>Let the <i>New Testament only be read as a book of seduction</i>: in it
virtue is appropriated, with the idea that public opinion is best
won with it,&mdash;and as a matter of fact it is a very modest kind of
<i>virtue,</i> which recognises only the ideal gregarious animal and nothing
more (including, of course, the herdsmen): a puny, soft, benevolent,
helpful, and gushingly-satisfied kind of virtue which to the outside
world is quite devoid of pretensions,&mdash;and which separates the "world"
entirely from itself. The <i>crassest arrogance</i> which fancies that the
destiny of man turns around it, and it alone, and that on the one side
the community of believers represents what is right, and on the other
the world represents what is false and eternally to be reproved and
rejected. The most <i>imbecile hatred</i> of all things in power, which,
however, never goes so far as to touch these things. A kind of <i>inner
detachment</i> which, outwardly, leaves everything as it was (servitude
and slavery; and knowing how to convert <i>everything</i> into a means of
serving God and virtue).</p>

<p>Christianity is possible as the <i>most private</i> form of life; it
presupposes the existence of a narrow, isolated, and absolutely
unpolitical society&mdash;it belongs to the conventicle. On the other hand,
a "Christian <i>State</i>," "Christian politics," are pieces of downright
impudence; they are lies, like, for instance, a Christian leadership
of an army, which in the end regards "the God of hosts" as chief of
the staff. Even the Papacy has never been able to carry on politics
in a Christian way...; and when Reformers indulge in politics, as
Luther did, it is well known that they are just as ardent followers of
Machiavelli as any other immoralists or tyrants.</p>


<p class="parnum">212.</p>

<p>Christianity is still possible at any moment. It is not bound to any
one of the impudent dogmas that have adorned themselves with its name:
it needs neither the teaching of the <i>personal God,</i> nor of <i>sin,</i>
nor of <i>immortality,</i> nor of <i>redemption,</i> nor of <i>faith</i>; it has
absolutely no need whatever of metaphysics, and it needs asceticism and
Christian "natural science" still less. Christianity is a <i>method of
life,</i> not a system of belief. It tells us how we should behave, not
what we should believe.</p>

<p>He who says to-day: "I refuse to be a soldier," "I care not for
tribunals," "I lay no claim to the services of the police," "I will
not do anything that disturbs the peace within me: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>and if I must
suffer on that account, nothing can so well maintain my inward peace as
suffering"&mdash;such a man would be a Christian.</p>


<p class="parnum">213.</p>

<p><i>Concerning the history of Christianity.</i>&mdash;Continual change of
environment: Christian teaching is thus continually changing its
<i>centre of gravity.</i> The favouring of <i>low</i> and <i>paltry</i> people....
The development of <i>Caritas....</i> The type "Christian" gradually
adopts everything that it originally rejected (<i>and in the rejection
of which it asserted its right to exist</i>). The Christian becomes a
citizen, a soldier, a judge, a workman, a merchant, a scholar, a
theologian, a priest, a philosopher, a farmer, an artist, a patriot,
a politician, a prince ... he re-enters all those <i>departments of
active life</i> which he had forsworn (he defends himself, he establishes
tribunals, he punishes, he swears, he differentiates between people
and people, he contemns, and he shows anger). The whole life of the
Christian is ultimately exactly that life <i>from which Christ preached
deliverance....</i> The Church is just as much a factor in the <i>triumph</i>
of the Antichrist, as the modern State and modern Nationalism.... The
Church is the barbarisation of Christianity.</p>


<p class="parnum">214.</p>

<p>Among the powers that have mastered <i>Christianity</i> are: Judaism
(<i>Paul</i>); Platonism (Augustine); The cult of mystery (the teaching of
salvation, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>the emblem of the "cross"); Asceticism (hostility towards
"Nature," "Reason," the "senses,"&mdash;the Orient ...).</p>


<p class="parnum">215.</p>

<p>Christianity is a denaturalisation of gregarious morality: under the
power of the most complete misapprehensions and self-deceptions.
Democracy is a more natural form of it, and less sown with falsehood.
It is a fact that the oppressed, the low, and whole mob of slaves and
half-castes, <i>will prevail.</i></p>

<p>First step: they make themselves free&mdash;they detach themselves, at
first in fancy only; they recognise each other; they make themselves
paramount.</p>

<p>Second step: they enter the lists, they demand acknowledgment, equal
rights, "Justice."</p>

<p>Third step: they demand privileges (they draw the representatives of
power over to their side).</p>

<p>Fourth step: they <i>alone</i> want all power, and they <i>have</i> it.</p>

<p>There are <i>three elements</i> in Christianity which must be distinguished:
<i>(a)</i> the oppressed of all kinds, <i>(b)</i> the mediocre of all kinds,
<i>(c)</i> the dissatisfied and diseased of all kinds. The <i>first</i> struggle
against the politically noble and their ideal; the second contend with
the exceptions and those who are in any way privileged (mentally or
physically); the third oppose the <i>natural instinct</i> of the happy and
the sound.</p>

<p>Whenever a triumph is achieved, the second <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>element steps to the fore;
for then Christianity has won over the sound and happy to its side
(as warriors in its cause), likewise the powerful (interested to this
extent in the conquest of the crowd)&mdash;and now it is the <i>gregarious
instinct,</i> that <i>mediocre nature</i> which is valuable in every respect,
that now gets its highest sanction through Christianity. This mediocre
nature ultimately becomes so conscious of itself (gains such courage
in regard to its own opinions), that it arrogates to itself even
<i>political power</i>....</p>

<p>Democracy is Christianity <i>made natural</i>: a sort of "return to Nature,"
once Christianity, owing to extreme anti-naturalness, might have been
overcome by the opposite valuation. Result: the aristocratic ideal
begins to <i>lose its natural character</i> ("the higher man," "noble,"
"artist," "passion," "knowledge"; Romanticism as the cult of the
exceptional, genius, etc. etc.).</p>


<p class="parnum">216.</p>

<p><i>When the "masters" may also become Christians.</i>&mdash;It is of the nature
of a <i>community</i> (race, family, herd, tribe) to regard all those
conditions and aspirations which favour its survival, as in themselves
<i>valuable</i>; for instance: obedience, mutual assistance, respect,
moderation, pity&mdash;as also, to <i>suppress</i> everything that happens to
stand in the way of the above.</p>

<p>It is likewise of the nature of the <i>rulers</i> (whether they are
individuals or classes) to patronise and applaud those virtues which
make <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>their subjects <i>amenable</i> and <i>submissive</i>&mdash;conditions and
passions which may be utterly different from their own.</p>

<p>The <i>gregarious instinct</i> and the <i>instinct of the rulers</i> sometimes
<i>agree</i> in approving of a certain number of qualities and
conditions,&mdash;but for different reasons: the first do so out of direct
egoism, the second out of indirect egoism.</p>

<p><i>The submission to Christianity on the part of master races</i> is
essentially the result of the conviction that Christianity is a
<i>religion for the herd,</i> that it teaches obedience: in short, that
Christians are more easily ruled than non-Christians. With a hint of
this nature, the Pope, even nowadays, recommends Christian propaganda
to the ruling Sovereign of China.</p>

<p>It should also be added that the seductive power of the Christian ideal
works most strongly upon natures that love danger, adventure, and
contrasts; that love everything <i>that entails a risk,</i> and wherewith a
<i>non plus ultra</i> of powerful feeling may be attained. In this respect,
one has only to think of Saint Theresa, surrounded by the heroic
instincts of her brothers:&mdash;Christianity appears in those circumstances
as a dissipation of the will, as strength of will, as a will that is
Quixotic.</p>


<hr />
<p class="title">3. Christian Ideals.</p>


<p class="parnum">217.</p>

<p>War against the <i>Christian ideal,</i> against the doctrine of
"blessedness" and "salvation" as the aims of life, against the
supremacy of the fools, of the pure in heart, of the suffering and of
the botched!</p>

<p>When and where has any man, <i>of any note at all,</i> resembled the
Christian ideal?&mdash;at least in the eyes of those who are psychologists
and triers of the heart and reins. Look at all Plutarch's heroes!</p>


<p class="parnum">218.</p>

<p><i>Our claim to superiority</i>: we live in an age of <i>Comparisons</i>; we
are able to calculate as men have never yet calculated; in every way
we are history become self-conscious. We enjoy things in a different
way; we suffer in a different way: our instinctive activity is the
comparison of an enormous variety of things. We understand everything;
we experience everything, we no longer have a hostile feeling left
within us. However disastrous the results may be to ourselves, our
plunging and almost lustful inquisitiveness, attacks, unabashed, the
most dangerous of subjects....</p>

<p>"Everything is good"&mdash;it gives us pain to say "nay" to anything. We
suffer when we feel that we are sufficiently foolish to make a definite
stand against anything.... At bottom, it is we scholars who to-day are
fulfilling Christ's teaching most thoroughly.</p>


<p class="parnum">219.</p>

<p>We cannot suppress a certain irony when we contemplate those who think
they have overcome Christianity by means of modern natural science.
Christian values are by no means overcome by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>such people. "Christ on
the cross" is still the most sublime symbol&mdash;even now....</p>


<p class="parnum">220.</p>

<p>The two great Nihilistic movements are: <i>(a)</i> Buddhism, <i>(b)</i>
Christianity. The latter has only just about reached a state of
culture in which it can fulfil its original object,&mdash;it has found its
<i>level,</i>&mdash;and now it can manifest itself <i>without disguise</i>.....</p>


<p class="parnum">221.</p>

<p>We have <i>re-established</i> the Christian ideal, it now only remains <i>to
determine</i> its value.</p>

<p>(1) Which values does it <i>deny</i>? What does <i>the ideal that opposes it</i>
stand for?&mdash;Pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuberant
spirits, splendid animalism, the instincts of war and of conquest;
the deification of passion, revenge, cunning, anger, voluptuousness,
adventure, knowledge&mdash;the <i>noble ideal</i> is denied: the beauty, wisdom,
power, pomp, and awfulness of the type man: the man who postulates
aims, the "future" man (here Christianity presents itself as the
<i>logical result</i> of <i>Judaism</i>).</p>

<p>(2) <i>Can it be realised?</i>&mdash;Yes, of course, when the climatic conditions
are favourable&mdash;as in the case of the Indian ideal. Both neglect the
factor <i>work.</i>&mdash;It separates a creature from a people, a state, a
civilised community, and jurisdiction; it rejects education, wisdom,
the cultivation of good manners, acquisition and commerce; it cuts
adrift <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>everything which is of use and value to men&mdash;by means of an
idiosyncrasy of sentiment it <i>isolates</i> a man. It is non-political,
anti-national, neither aggressive nor defensive,&mdash;and only possible
within a strictly-ordered State or state of society, which allows these
<i>holy parasites</i> to flourish at the cost of their neighbours.....</p>

<p>(3) It has now become the will to be <i>happy</i>&mdash;and nothing else!
"Blessedness" stands for something self-evident, that no longer
requires any justification&mdash;everything else (the way to live and let
live) is only a means to an end....</p>

<p>But what follows is the result of a <i>low order of thought,</i> the fear of
pain, of defilement, of corruption, is great enough to provide ample
grounds for allowing everything to go to the dogs.... This is a <i>poor</i>
way of thinking, and is the sign of an exhausted race; we <i>must</i> not
allow ourselves to be deceived. ("Become as little children." Natures
<i>of the same order</i>: Francis of Assisi, neurotic, epileptic, visionary,
like Jesus.)</p>


<p class="parnum">222.</p>

<p>The <i>higher</i> man distinguishes himself from the <i>lower</i> by his
fearlessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune: it is a
sign of <i>degeneration</i> when eudemonistic values begin to prevail
(physiological fatigue and enfeeblement of will-power). Christianity,
with its prospect of "blessedness," is the typical attitude of mind of
a suffering and impoverished species of man. Abundant strength will be
active, will suffer, and will go under: to it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>the bigotry of Christian
salvation is bad music and hieratic posing and vexation.</p>


<p class="parnum">223.</p>

<p><i>Poverty, humility, and chastity</i> are dangerous and slanderous ideals;
but like poisons, which are useful cures in the case of certain
diseases, they were also necessary in the time of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>All ideals are dangerous: because they lower and brand realities; they
are all poisons, but occasionally indispensable as cures.</p>


<p class="parnum">224.</p>

<p>God created man, happy, idle, innocent, and immortal: our actual life
is a false, decadent, and sinful existence, a punishment.... Suffering,
struggle, work, and death are raised as objections against life, they
make life questionable, unnatural&mdash;something that must cease, and for
which one not only requires but also <i>has</i>&mdash;remedies!</p>

<p>Since the time of Adam, man has been in an abnormal state: God
Himself delivered up His Son for Adam's sin, in order to put an end
to the abnormal condition of things: the natural character of life
is a <i>curse</i>; to those who believe in Him, Christ restores normal
life: He makes them happy, idle, and innocent. But the world did not
become fruitful without labour; women do not bear children without
pain; illness has not ceased: believers are served just as badly as
unbelievers in this respect. All that has happened <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>is, that man is
delivered from <i>death</i> and <i>sin&mdash;</i>two assertions which allow of no
verification, and which are therefore emphasised by the Church with
more than usual heartiness. "He is free from sin,"&mdash;not owing to
his own efforts, not owing to a vigorous struggle on his part, but
<i>redeemed by the death of the Saviour,</i>&mdash;consequently, perfectly
innocent and paradisaical.</p>

<p><i>Actual</i> life is nothing more than an illusion (that is to say, a
deception, an insanity). The whole of struggling, fighting, and
real existence&mdash;so full of light and shade, is only bad and false:
everybody's duty is to be <i>delivered</i> from it.</p>

<p>"Man, innocent, idle, immortal, and happy"&mdash;this concept, which is
the object of the "most supreme desires," must be criticised before
anything else. Why should guilt, work, death, and pain (<i>and,</i> from
the Christian point of view, also <i>knowledge</i> ...) be <i>contrary</i> to
all supreme desires?&mdash;The lazy Christian notions: "blessedness,"
"innocence," "immortality."</p>


<p class="parnum">225.</p>

<p>The eccentric concept "holiness" does not exist&mdash;"God" and "man" have
not been divorced from each other. "Miracles" do not exist&mdash;such
spheres do not exist: the only one to be considered is the
"intellectual" (that is to say, the symbolically-psychological). As
decadence: a counterpart to "Epicureanism." ... Paradise according to
Greek notions was only "Epicurus' Garden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
A life of this sort lacks a purpose: it <i>strives after</i> nothing;&mdash;a
form of the "Epicurean gods"&mdash;there is no longer any reason to aim at
anything,&mdash;not even at having children:&mdash;everything has been done.</p>


<p class="parnum">226.</p>

<p>They despised the body: they did not reckon with it: nay, more&mdash;they
treated it as an enemy. It was their delirium to think that a man
could carry a "beautiful soul" about in a body that was a cadaverous
abortion.... In order to inoculate others with this insanity they
had to present the concept "beautiful soul" in a different way, and
to transvalue the natural value, until, at last, a pale, sickly,
idiotically exalted creature, something angelic, some extreme
perfection and transfiguration was declared to be the higher man.</p>


<p class="parnum">227.</p>

<p>Ignorance in matters psychological.&mdash;The Christian has no nervous
system;&mdash;contempt for, and deliberate and wilful turning away from, the
demands of the body, and the <i>naked</i> body; it is assumed that all this
is in keeping with man's nature, and <i>must perforce work the ultimate
good of the soul</i>;&mdash;all functions of the body are systematically
reduced to moral values; illness itself is regarded as determined by
morality, it is held to be the result of sin, or it is a trial or a
state of salvation, through which man becomes more perfect than he
could become in a state <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>of health (Pascal's idea); under certain
circumstances, there are wilful attempts at inducing illness.</p>


<p class="parnum">228.</p>

<p>What in sooth is this struggle "against Nature" on the part of the
Christian? We shall not, of course, let ourselves be deceived by
his words and explanations. It is Nature against something which is
also Nature. With many, it is fear; with others, it is loathing;
with yet others, it is the sign of a certain intellectuality, the
love of a bloodless and passionless ideal; and in the case of the
most superior men, it is love of an abstract Nature&mdash;these try to
live up to their ideal. It is easily understood that humiliation in
the place of self-esteem, anxious cautiousness towards the passions,
emancipation from the usual duties (whereby, a higher notion of rank is
created), the incitement to constant war on behalf of enormous issues,
habituation to effusiveness of feelings&mdash;all this goes to constitute
a type: in such a type the <i>hypersensitiveness</i> of a perishing body
preponderates; but the nervousness and the inspirations it engenders
are <i>interpreted</i> differently. The <i>taste</i> of this kind of creature
tends either (1) to subtilise, (2) to indulge in bombastic eloquence,
or (3) to go in for extreme feelings. The natural inclinations <i>do</i>
get satisfied, but they are interpreted in a new way; for instance,
as "justification before God," "the feeling of redemption through
grace," every undeniable <i>feeling of pleasure</i> becomes (interpreted
in this way!) pride, voluptuousness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>etc. General problem: what will
become of the man who slanders and practically denies and belittles
what is natural? As a matter of fact, the Christian is an example of
exaggerated self-control: in order to tame his passions, he seems to
find it necessary to extirpate or crucify them.</p>


<p class="parnum">229.</p>

<p>Man did not know himself physiologically throughout the ages his
history covers; he does not even know himself now. The knowledge, for
instance, that man has a nervous system (but no "soul") is still the
privilege of the most educated people. But man is not satisfied, in
this respect, to say he does not know. A man must be very superior to
be able to say: "I do not know this,"&mdash;that is to say, to be able to
admit his ignorance.</p>

<p>Suppose he is in pain or in a good mood, he never questions that he
can find the reason of either condition if only he seeks.... In truth,
he cannot find the reason; for he does not even suspect where it
lies.... What happens?... He takes the <i>result</i> of his condition for
its <i>cause</i>; for instance, if he should undertake some work (really
undertaken because his good mood gave him the courage to do so) and
carry it through successfully: behold, the work itself is the <i>reason</i>
of his good mood.... As a matter of fact, his success was determined by
the same cause as that which brought about his good mood&mdash;that is to
say, the happy co-ordination of physiological powers and functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
He feels bad: <i>consequently</i> he cannot overcome a care, a scruple,
or an attitude of self-criticism.... He really fancies that his
disagreeable condition is the result of his scruple, of his "sin," or
of his "self-criticism."</p>

<p>But after profound exhaustion and prostration, a state of recovery sets
in. "How is it possible that I can feel so free, so happy? It is a
miracle; only a God could have effected this change."&mdash;Conclusion: "He
has forgiven my sin." ...</p>

<p>From this follow certain practices: in order to provoke feelings of
sinfulness and to prepare the way for crushed spirits it is necessary
to induce a condition of morbidity and nervousness in the body. The
methods of doing this are well known. Of course, nobody suspects
the causal logic of the fact: the <i>maceration</i> of the <i>flesh</i> is
interpreted religiously, it seems like an end in itself, whereas it
is no more than a <i>means</i> of bringing about that morbid state of
indigestion which is known as repentance (the "fixed idea" of sin, the
hypnotising of the hen by-means of the chalk-line "sin").</p>

<p>The mishandling of the body prepares the ground for the required range
of "guilty feelings"&mdash;that is to say, for that general state of pain
which <i>demands an explanation....</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, the <i>method</i> of "salvation" may also develop
from the above: every dissipation of the feelings, whether prayers,
movements, attitudes, or oaths, has been provoked, and exhaustion
follows; very often it is acute, or it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>appears in the form of
epilepsy. And behind this condition of deep somnolence there come signs
of recovery&mdash;or, in religious parlance, "Salvation."</p>


<p class="parnum">230.</p>

<p>Formerly, the conditions and results of <i>physiological exhaustion</i> were
considered more important than healthy conditions and their results,
and this was owing to the suddenness, fearfulness, and mysteriousness
of the former. Men were terrified by themselves, and postulated the
existence of a <i>higher</i> world. People have ascribed the origin of the
idea of two worlds&mdash;one this side of the grave and the other beyond
it&mdash;to sleep and dreams, to shadows, to night, and to the fear of
Nature: but the symptoms of physiological exhaustion should, above all,
have been considered.</p>

<p>Ancient religions have quite special methods of disciplining the
pious into states of exhaustion, in which they <i>must</i> experience such
things.... The idea was, that one entered into a new order of things,
where everything ceases to be known.&mdash;The <i>semblance</i> of a higher
power....</p>


<p class="parnum">231.</p>

<p>Sleep is the result of every kind of exhaustion; exhaustion follows
upon all excessive excitement....</p>

<p>In all pessimistic religions and philosophies there is a yearning for
sleep; the very notion "sleep" is deified and worshipped.</p>

<p>In this case the exhaustion is racial; sleep <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>regarded psychologically
is only a symbol of a much deeper and longer <i>compulsion to rest....
In praxi</i> it is death which rules here in the seductive image of its
brother sleep....</p>


<p class="parnum">232.</p>

<p>The whole of the Christian training in repentance and redemption may
be regarded as a <i>folie circulaire</i> arbitrarily produced; though,
of course, it can be produced only in people who are predisposed to
it&mdash;that is to say, who have morbid tendencies in their constitutions.</p>


<p class="parnum">233.</p>

<p><i>Against remorse and its purely psychical treatment.</i>&mdash;To be unable
to have done with an experience is already a sign of decadence.
This reopening of old wounds, this wallowing in self-contempt and
depression, is an additional form of disease; no "salvation of the
soul" ever results from it, but only a new kind of spiritual illness....</p>

<p>These "conditions of salvation" of which the Christian is conscious are
merely variations of the same diseased state&mdash;the interpretation of an
attack of epilepsy by means of a particular formula which is provided,
<i>not</i> by science, but by religious mania.</p>

<p>When a man is ill his very <i>goodness</i> is sickly.... By far the
greatest portion of the psychical apparatus which Christianity has
used, is now classed among the various forms of hysteria and epilepsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
The whole process of spiritual healing must be remodelled on a
physiological basis: the "sting of conscience" as such is an obstacle
in the way of recovery&mdash;as soon as possible the attempt must be made
to counterbalance everything by means of new actions, so that there
may be an escape from the morbidness of <i>self-torture....</i> The purely
psychical practices of the Church and of the various sects should be
decried as dangerous to the health. No invalid is ever cured by prayers
or by the exorcising of evil spirits: the states of "repose" which
follow upon such methods of treatment, by no means inspire confidence,
in the psychological sense....</p>



<p>A man is <i>healthy</i> when he can laugh at the seriousness and ardour with
which he has allowed himself to be <i>hypnotised</i> to any extent by any
detail in his life&mdash;when his remorse seems to him like the action of a
dog biting a stone&mdash;when he is ashamed of his repentance.</p>

<p>The purely psychological and religious practices, which have existed
hitherto, only led to an <i>alteration in the symptoms</i>: according to
them a man had recovered when he bowed before the cross, and swore
that in future he would be a good man.... But a criminal, who, with
a certain gloomy seriousness cleaves to his fate and refuses to
malign his deed once it is done, has more <i>spiritual health....</i>
The criminals with whom Dostoiewsky associated in prison, were all,
without exception, unbroken natures,&mdash;are they not a hundred times more
valuable than a "broken-spirited" Christian?</p>

<p>A <i>pang of conscience</i> in a man is a sign that his character is not
yet equal to his <i>deed.</i> There is such a thing as a pang of conscience
after <i>good deeds</i>: in this case it is their unfamiliarity, their
incompatibility with an old environment.</p>


<p class="parnum">235.</p>

<p><i>Against remorse.</i>&mdash;I do not like this form of cowardice in regard to
one's own actions, one must not leave one's self in the lurch under
the pressure of sudden shame or distress. Extreme pride is much more
fitting here. What is the good of it all in the end! No deed gets
undone because it is regretted, no more than because it is "forgiven"
or "expiated." A man must be a theologian in order to believe in
a power that erases faults: we immoralists prefer to disbelieve
in "faults." We believe that all deeds, of what kind soever, are
identically the same at root; just as deeds which turn <i>against</i> us
may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>be useful from an economical point of view, and even <i>generally
desirable.</i> In certain individual cases, we admit that we might well
have been <i>spared</i> a given action; the circumstances alone predisposed
us in its favour. Which of us, if <i>favoured</i> by circumstances, would
not already have committed every possible crime?... That is why one
should never say: "Thou shouldst never have done such and such a
thing," but only: "How strange it is that I have not done such and
such a thing hundreds of times already!"&mdash;As a matter of fact, only
a very small number of acts are <i>typical</i> acts and real epitomes of
a personality, and seeing what a small number of people really are
personalities, a single act very rarely <i>characterises</i> a man. Acts
are mostly dictated by circumstances; they are superficial or merely
reflex movements performed in response to a stimulus, long before the
depths of our beings are affected or consulted in the matter. A fit of
temper, a gesture, a blow with a knife: how little of the individual
resides in these acts!&mdash;A deed very often brings a sort of stupor or
feeling of constraint in its wake: so that the agent feels almost
spellbound at its recollection, or as though he <i>belonged to it,</i>
and were not an independent creature. This mental disorder, which is
a form of hypnotism, must be resisted at all costs: surely a single
deed, whatever it be, when it is compared with all one has done, is
<i>nothing,</i> and may be deducted from the sum without making the account
wrong. The unfair interest which society manifests in controlling the
whole of our lives <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>in one direction, as though the very purpose of its
existence were to cultivate a certain individual act, should not infect
the man of action: but unfortunately this happens almost continually.
The reason of this is, that every deed, if followed by unexpected
consequences, leads to a certain mental disturbance, no matter whether
the consequences be good or bad. Behold a lover who has been given a
promise, or a poet while he is receiving applause from an audience:
as far as <i>intellectual torpor</i> is concerned, these men are in no way
different from the anarchist who is suddenly confronted by a detective
bearing a search warrant.</p>

<p>There are some acts which are <i>unworthy</i> of us: acts which, if they
were regarded as typical, would set us down as belonging to a lower
class of man. The one fault that has to be avoided here, is to regard
them as typical. There is another kind of act of which <i>we</i> are
unworthy: exceptional acts, born of a particular abundance of happiness
and health; they are the highest waves of our spring tides, driven to
an unusual height by a storm&mdash;an accident: such acts and "deeds" are
also not typical. An artist should never be judged according to the
measure of his works.</p>


<p class="parnum">236.</p>

<p>A. In proportion as Christianity seems necessary to-day, man is still
wild and fatal....</p>

<p>B. In another sense, it is not necessary, but extremely dangerous,
though it is captivating and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>seductive, because it corresponds with
the <i>morbid</i> character of whole classes and types of modern humanity,
... they simply follow their inclinations when they aspire to
Christianity&mdash;they are decadents of all kinds.</p>

<p>A and B must be kept very sharply apart. In the <i>case of A,</i>
Christianity is a cure, or at least a taming process (under certain
circumstances it serves the purpose of making people ill: and this is
sometimes useful as a means of subduing savage and brutal natures).
In the <i>case of B,</i> it is a symptom of illness itself, it renders the
state of decadence <i>more acute</i>; in this case it stands opposed to
a <i>corroborating</i> system of treatment, it is the invalid's instinct
standing <i>against</i> that which would be most salutary to him.</p>


<p class="parnum">237.</p>

<p>On one side there are the <i>serious,</i> the <i>dignified,</i> and <i>reflective</i>
people: and on the other the barbarous, the unclean, and the
irresponsible beasts: it is merely a question of <i>taming animals</i>&mdash;and
in this case the tamer must be hard, terrible, and awe-inspiring, at
least to his beasts.</p>

<p>All essential requirements must be imposed upon the unruly creatures
with almost brutal distinctness&mdash;that is to say, magnified a thousand
times.</p>

<p>Even the fulfilment of the requirement must be presented in the
coarsest way possible, so that it may command respect, as in the case
of the spiritualisation of the Brahmins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The struggle with the rabble
and the herd.</i> If any degree of tameness and order has been reached,
the chasm separating these <i>purified</i> and <i>regenerated</i> people from the
terrible <i>remainder</i> must have been bridged....</p>

<p>This chasm is a means of increasing self-respect in higher castes,
and of confirming their belief in <i>that</i> which they represent&mdash;hence
the <i>Chandala.</i> Contempt and its excess are perfectly correct
psychologically&mdash;that is to say, magnified a hundred times, so that it
may at least be felt.</p>


<p class="parnum">238.</p>

<p>The struggle against <i>brutal</i> instincts is quite different from
the struggle against <i>morbid</i> instincts; it may even be a means
of overcoming brutality by making the brutes <i>ill.</i> The psychical
treatment practised by Christianity is often nothing more than the
process of converting a brute into a sick and <i>therefore</i> tame animal.</p>

<p>The struggle against raw and savage natures must be a struggle with
weapons which are able to affect such natures: <i>superstitions</i> and such
means are therefore indispensable and essential.</p>


<p class="parnum">239.</p>

<p>Our age, in a certain sense, is <i>mature</i> (that is to say, decadent),
just as Buddha's was.... That is why a sort of Christianity is possible
without all the absurd dogmas (the most repulsive offshoots of ancient
hybridism).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">240.</p>

<p>Supposing it were impossible to disprove Christianity, Pascal thinks,
in view of the <i>terrible</i> possibility that it may be true, that it is
in the highest degree prudent to be a Christian. As a proof of how
much Christianity has lost of its terrible nature, to-day we find that
other attempt to justify it, which consists in asserting, that even if
it were a mistake, it nevertheless provides the greatest advantages
and pleasures for its adherents throughout their lives:&mdash;it therefore
seems that this belief should be upheld owing to the peace and quiet
it ensures&mdash;not owing to the terror of a threatening possibility, but
rather out of fear of a life that has lost its charm. This hedonistic
turn of thought, which uses happiness as a proof, is a symptom of
decline: it takes the place of the proof resulting from power or from
that which to the Christian mind is most terrible&mdash;namely, <i>fear.</i> With
this new interpretation, Christianity is, as a matter of fact, nearing
its stage of exhaustion. People are satisfied with a Christianity which
is an <i>opiate,</i> because they no longer have the strength to seek, to
struggle, to dare, to stand alone, nor to take up Pascal's position and
to share that gloomily brooding self-contempt, that belief in human
unworthiness, and that anxiety which believes that it "may be damned."
But a Christianity the chief object of which is to soothe diseased
nerves, does <i>not require</i> the terrible solution consisting of a "God
on the cross"; that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>is why Buddhism is secretly gaining ground all
over Europe.</p>


<p class="parnum">241.</p>

<p>The humour of European culture: people regard one thing as true, but do
<i>the other.</i> For instance, what is the use of all the art of reading
and criticising, if the ecclesiastical interpretation of the Bible,
whether according to Catholics or Protestants, is still upheld!</p>


<p class="parnum">242.</p>

<p>No one is sufficiently aware of the barbarity of the notions among
which we Europeans still live. To think that men have been able to
believe that the "Salvation of the soul" depended upon a book!... And I
am told that this is still believed.</p>



<p>What is the good of all scientific education, all criticism and all
hermeneutics, if such nonsense as the Church's interpretation of the
Bible has not yet turned the colours of our bodies permanently into the
red of shame?</p>


<p class="parnum">243.</p>

<p><i>Subject for reflection</i>: To what extent does the fatal belief in
"Divine Providence"&mdash;the most <i>paralysing</i> belief for both the hand
and the understanding that has ever existed&mdash;continue to prevail;
to what extent have the Christian hypothesis and interpretation of
Life continued their lives <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>under the cover of terms like "Nature,"
"Progress," "perfectionment," "Darwinism," or beneath the superstition
that there is a certain relation between happiness and virtue,
unhappiness and sin? That absurd <i>belief</i> in the course of things, in
"Life" and in the "instinct of Life"; that foolish <i>resignation</i> which
arises from the notion that if only every one did his duty <i>all</i> would
go well&mdash;all this sort of thing can only have a meaning if one assumes
that there is a direction of things <i>sub specie boni.</i> Even <i>fatalism,</i>
our present form of philosophical sensibility, is the result of a
<i>long</i> belief in Divine Providence, an unconscious result: as though it
were nothing to do with us how everything goes! (As though we <i>might</i>
let things take their own course; the individual being only a <i>modus</i>
of the absolute reality.)</p>


<p class="parnum">244.</p>

<p>It is the height of psychological falsity on the part of man to imagine
a being according to his own petty standard, who is a beginning, a
"thing-in-itself," and who appears to him good, wise, mighty, and
precious; for thus he suppresses in thoughts <i>all the causality</i>
by means of which every kind of goodness, wisdom, and power comes
into existence and has value. In short, elements of the most recent
and most conditional origin were regarded not as evolved, but as
spontaneously generated and "things-in-themselves," and perhaps as
the cause of all things.... Experience teaches us that, in every
case in which a man has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>elevated himself to any great extent
above the average of his fellows, every high degree of <i>power</i> always
involves a corresponding degree of <i>freedom</i> from Good and Evil as also
from "true" and "false," and cannot take into account what goodness
dictates: the same holds good of a high degree of wisdom&mdash;in this case
goodness is just as much suppressed as truthfulness, justice, virtue,
and other popular whims in valuations. In fact, is it not obvious that
every high degree of goodness itself presupposes a certain intellectual
myopia and obtuseness? as also an inability to distinguish at a great
distance between true and false, useful and harmful?—not to mention
the fact that a high degree of power in the hands of the highest
goodness might lead to the most baleful consequences ("the suppression
of evil"). In sooth it is enough to perceive with what aspirations the
"God of Love" inspires His believers: they ruin mankind for the benefit
of "good men." In practice, this same God has shown Himself to be a God
of the most <i>acute myopia, devilry</i>, and <i>impotence</i>, in the face of
the actual arrangement of the universe, and from this the value of His
conception may be estimated.

Knowledge and wisdom can have no value in themselves, any more than
goodness can: the goal they are striving after must be known first, for
then only can their value or worthlessness be judged&mdash;<i>a goal might be</i>
imagined which would make excessive wisdom a great disadvantage (if,
for instance, complete deception were a prerequisite to the enhancement
of life; likewise, if goodness <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>were able to paralyse and
depress the main springs of the great passions)....</p>

<p>Taking our human life as it is, it cannot be denied that all "truth,"
"goodness," "holiness," and "Godliness" in the Christian sense, have
hitherto shown themselves to be great dangers&mdash;even now mankind is in
danger of perishing owing to an ideal which is hostile to life.</p>


<p class="parnum">245.</p>

<p>Let any one think of the <i>loss</i> which all human institutions suffer,
when a divine and transcendental, <i>higher sphere</i> is postulated which
must first sanction these institutions! By recognising their worth
in this sanction alone (as in the case of marriage, for instance)
<i>their natural dignity is reduced</i>, and under certain circumstances
<i>denied</i>.... Nature is spitefully misjudged in the same ratio as the
anti-natural notion of a God is held in honour. "Nature" then comes to
mean no more than "contemptible," "bad." ...</p>

<p>The fatal nature of a belief in God as the <i>reality of the highest
moral qualities</i>: through it, all real values were denied and
systematically regarded as <i>valueless</i>. Thus <i>Anti-Nature</i> ascended
the throne. With relentless logic the last step was reached, and this
was the absolute demand to <i>deny Nature.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">246.</p>

<p>By pressing the doctrine of disinterestedness and love into the
foreground, Christianity by no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>means elevated the interests
of the species above those of the individual. Its real <i>historical</i>
effect, its fatal effect, remains precisely the <i>increase of egotism,</i>
of individual egotism, to excess (to the extreme which consists in
the belief in individual immortality). The individual was made so
important and so absolute, by means of Christian values, that he could
no longer be <i>sacrificed,</i> despite the fact that the species can
only be maintained by human sacrifices. All "souls" became <i>equal</i>
before God: but this is the most pernicious of all valuations! If
one regards individuals as equals, the demands of the species are
ignored, and a process is initiated which ultimately leads to its
ruin. Christianity is the <i>reverse of the</i> principle of <i>selection.</i>
If the degenerate and sick man ("the Christian") is to be of the same
value as the healthy man ("the pagan"), or if he is even to be valued
higher than the latter, as Pascal's view of health and sickness would
have us value him, the natural course of evolution is thwarted and the
<i>unnatural</i> becomes law.... In practice this general love of mankind
is nothing more than deliberately favouring all the suffering, the
botched, and the degenerate: it is this love that has reduced and
weakened the power, responsibility, and lofty duty of sacrificing
men. According to the scheme of Christian values, all that remained
was the alternative of self-sacrifice, but this <i>vestige</i> of human
sacrifice, which Christianity conceded and even recommended, has no
meaning when regarded in the light of rearing a whole species. The
prosperity of the species is by no means affected by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>the sacrifice of
one individual (whether in the monastic and ascetic manner, or by means
of crosses, stakes, and scaffolds, as the "martyrs" of error). What the
species requires is the suppression of the physiologically botched,
the weak and the degenerate: but it was precisely to these people that
Christianity appealed as a <i>preservative</i> force, it simply strengthened
that natural and very strong instinct of all the weak which bids them
protect, maintain, and mutually support each other. What is Christian
"virtue" and "love of men," if not precisely this mutual assistance
with a view to survival, this solidarity of the weak, this thwarting of
selection? What is Christian altruism, if it is not the mob-egotism of
the weak which divines that, if everybody looks after everybody else,
every individual will be preserved for a longer period of time?... He
who does not consider this attitude of mind as <i>immoral,</i> as a crime
against life, himself belongs to the sickly crowd, and also shares
their instincts.... Genuine love of mankind exacts sacrifice for
the good of the species&mdash;it is hard, full of self-control, because
it needs human sacrifices. And this pseudo-humanity which is called
Christianity, would fain establish the rule that nobody should be
sacrificed.</p>


<p class="parnum">247.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more useful and deserves more promotion than
systematic <i>Nihilism in action.</i>&mdash;As I understand the phenomena of
Christianity and pessimism, this is what they say: "We <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>are ripe for
nonentity, for us it is reasonable not to be." This hint from "reason"
in this case, is simply the voice of <i>selective Nature.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, what deserves the most rigorous condemnation, is
the ambiguous and cowardly infirmity of purpose of a religion like
<i>Christianity,</i>&mdash;or rather like the <i>Church,</i>&mdash;which, instead of
recommending death and self-destruction, actually protects all the
botched and bungled, and encourages them to propagate their kind.</p>

<p>Problem: with what kind of means could one lead up to a severe form of
really contagious Nihilism&mdash;a Nihilism which would teach and practise
voluntary death with scientific conscientiousness (and not the feeble
continuation of a vegetative sort of life with false hopes of a life
after death)?</p>

<p>Christianity cannot be sufficiently condemned for having depreciated
the <i>value</i> of a great <i>cleansing</i> Nihilistic movement (like the one
which was probably in the process of formation), by its teaching of
the immortality of the private individual, as also by the hopes of
resurrection which it held out: that is to say, by dissuading people
from performing the <i>deed of Nihilism</i> which is suicide.... In the
latter's place it puts lingering suicide, and gradually a puny, meagre,
but durable life; gradually a perfectly ordinary, bourgeois, mediocre
life, etc.</p>


<p class="parnum">248.</p>

<p><i>Christian moral quackery.</i>&mdash;Pity and contempt succeed each other at
short intervals, and at the sight of them I feel as indignant as if I
were in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>the presence of the most despicable crime. Here error is made
a duty&mdash;a virtue, misapprehension has become a knack, the destructive
instinct is systematised under the name of "redemption"; here every
operation becomes a wound, an amputation of those very organs whose
energy would be the prerequisite to a return of health. And in the
best of cases no cure is effected; all that is done is to exchange one
set of evil symptoms for another set.... And this pernicious nonsense,
this systematised profanation and castration of life, passes for
holy and sacred; to be in its service, to be an instrument of this
art of healing&mdash;that is to say, to be a priest, is to be rendered
distinguished, reverent, holy, and sacred. God alone could have been
the Author of this supreme art of healing; redemption is only possible
as a revelation, as an act of grace, as an unearned gift, made by the
Creator Himself.</p>

himself and others, crushed by humility and modesty, and conscious of
his weakness,&mdash;in fact, the "sinner,"&mdash;this is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>desirable type, and
one which one can <i>produce</i> by means of a little spiritual surgery....</p>


<p class="parnum">249.</p>

<p>What is it I protest against? That people should regard this paltry and
peaceful mediocrity, this spiritual equilibrium which knows nothing
of the fine impulses of great accumulations of strength, as something
high, or possibly as the standard of all things.</p>

<p><i>Bacon of Verulam</i> says: <i>Infimarum virtutum apud vulgus laus est,
mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus.</i> Christianity as a
religion, however, belongs to the <i>vulgus</i>: it has no feeling for the
highest kind of <i>virtus</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">250.</p>

<p>Let us see what the "genuine Christian" does of all the things which
his instincts forbid him to do:&mdash;he covers beauty, pride, riches,
self-reliance, brilliancy, knowledge, and power with suspicion and
<i>mud</i>&mdash;in short, <i>all culture</i>: his object is to deprive the latter of
its <i>clean conscience.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">251.</p>

<p>The attacks made upon Christianity, hitherto, have been not only timid
but false. So long as Christian morality was not felt to be a <i>capital
crime against Life,</i> its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>apologists had a good time. The question
concerning the mere "truth" of Christianity&mdash;whether in regard to the
existence of its God, or to the legendary history of its origin, not to
speak of its astronomy and natural science&mdash;is quite beside the point
so long as no inquiry is made into the value of Christian <i>morality.</i>
Are Christian morals <i>worth anything,</i> or are they a profanation and an
outrage, despite all the arts of holiness and seduction with which they
are enforced? The question concerning the truth of the religion may be
met by all sorts of subterfuges; and the most fervent believers can,
in the end, avail themselves of the logic used by their opponents, in
order to create a right for their side to assert that certain things
are irrefutable&mdash;that is to say, they <i>transcend</i> the means employed
to refute them (nowadays this trick of dialectics is called "Kantian
Criticism").</p>


<p class="parnum">252.</p>

<p>Christianity should never be forgiven for having ruined such men as
Pascal. This is precisely what should be combated in Christianity,
namely, that it has the will to break the spirit of the strongest
and noblest natures. One should take no rest until this thing is
utterly destroyed:&mdash;the ideal of mankind which Christianity advances,
the demands it makes upon men, and its "Nay" and "Yea" relative to
humanity. The whole of the remaining absurdities, that is to say,
Christian fable, Christian cobweb-spinning in ideas and principles,
and Christian theology, do not concern us; they might be a thousand
times more absurd <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>and we should not raise a finger to destroy them.
But what we do stand up against, is that ideal which, thanks to its
morbid beauty and feminine seductiveness, thanks to its insidious and
slanderous eloquence, appeals to all the cowardices and vanities of
wearied souls,&mdash;and the strongest have their moments of fatigue,&mdash;as
though all that which seems most useful and desirable at such
moments&mdash;that is to say, confidence, artlessness, modesty, patience,
love of one's like, resignation, submission to God, and a sort of
self-surrender&mdash;were useful and desirable <i>per se</i>; as though the puny,
modest abortion which in these creatures takes the place of a soul,
this virtuous, mediocre animal and sheep of the flock&mdash;which deigns to
call itself man, were not only to take precedence of the stronger, more
evil, more passionate, more defiant, and more prodigal type of man, who
by virtue of these very qualities is exposed to a hundred times more
dangers than the former, but were actually to stand as an ideal for man
in general, as a goal, a measure&mdash;the highest desideratum. The creation
of <i>this</i> ideal was the most appalling temptation that had ever
been put in the way of mankind; for, with it, the stronger and more
successful exceptions, the lucky cases among men, in which the will
to power and to growth leads the whole species "man" one step farther
forward, this type was threatened with disaster. By means of the values
of this ideal, the growth of such higher men would be checked at the
root. For these men, owing to their superior demands and duties,
readily accept a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>more dangerous life (speaking economically, it is a
case of an increase in the costs of the undertaking coinciding with
a greater chance of failure). What is it we combat in Christianity?
That it aims at destroying the strong, at breaking their spirit, at
exploiting their moments of weariness and debility, at converting
their proud assurance into anxiety and conscience-trouble; that it
knows how to poison the noblest instincts and to infect them with
disease, until their strength, their will to power, turns inwards,
against themselves&mdash;until the strong perish through their excessive
self-contempt and self-immolation: that gruesome way of perishing, of
which <i>Pascal</i> is the most famous example.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>


<p class="title2">A CRITICISM OF MORALITY.</p>

<hr />
<p class="title">1. The Origin of Moral Valuations.</p>


<p class="parnum">253.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at investigating morality without being affected by
its charm, and not without some mistrust in regard to the beguiling
beauty of its attitudes and looks. A world which we can admire, which
is in keeping with our capacity for worship&mdash;which is continually
<i>demonstrating</i> itself&mdash;in small things or in large: this is the
Christian standpoint which is common to us all.</p>

<p>But owing to an increase in our astuteness, in our mistrust, and in our
scientific spirit (also through a more developed instinct for truth,
which again is due to Christian influence), this interpretation has
grown ever less and less tenable for us.</p>

<p>The craftiest of subterfuges: Kantian criticism. The intellect not
only denies itself every right to interpret things in that way, but
also to reject the interpretation once it has been made. People are
satisfied with a <i>greater</i> demand upon their credulity and faith, with
a renunciation of all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>right to reason concerning the proof of their
creed, with an intangible and superior "Ideal" (God) as a stop-gap.</p>

<p>The Hegelian subterfuge, a continuation of the Platonic, a piece
of romanticism and reaction, and at the same time a symptom of
the historical sense of a new <i>power</i>: "Spirit" itself is the
"self-revealing and self-realising ideal": we believe that in the
"process of, development" an ever greater proportion of this ideal is
being manifested&mdash;thus the ideal is being realised, faith is vested in
the <i>future</i> into which all its noble needs are projected and in which
they are being worshipped.</p>

<p>In short:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) God is unknowable to us and not to be demonstrated by us (the
concealed meaning behind the whole of the epistemological movement);</p>

<p>(2) God may be demonstrated, but as something evolving, and we are
part of it, as our pressing desire for an ideal proves (the concealed
meaning behind the historical movement).</p>

<p>It should be observed that criticism is <i>never</i> levelled at the ideal
itself, but only at the problem which gives rise to a controversy
concerning the ideal&mdash;that is to say, why it has not yet been realised,
or why it is not demonstrable in small things as in great.</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>It makes all the difference: whether a man recognises this state of
distress as such owing to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>a passion or to a yearning in himself, or
whether it comes home to him as a problem which he arrives at only by
straining his thinking powers and his historical imagination to the
utmost.</p>

<p>Away from the religious and philosophical points of view we find the
same phenomena. Utilitarianism (socialism and democracy) criticises
the origin of moral valuations, though it believes in them just as
much as the Christian does. (What guilelessness! As if morality could
remain when the sanctioning <i>deity</i> is no longer present! The belief in
a "Beyond" is absolutely necessary, if the faith in morality is to be
maintained.)</p>

<p><i>Fundamental problem</i>: whence comes this almighty power of <i>Faith?
Whence this faith in morality?</i> (It is betrayed by the fact that even
the fundamental conditions of life are falsely interpreted in favour of
it: despite our knowledge of plants and animals. "Self-preservation":
the Darwinian prospect of a reconciliation of the altruistic and
egotistic principles.)</p>


<p class="parnum">254.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the <i>origin of our moral valuations</i> and tables of
law has absolutely nothing to do with the <i>criticism</i> of them, though
people persist in believing it has; the two matters lie quite apart,
notwithstanding the fact that the knowledge of the <i>pudenda origo</i>
of a valuation does diminish its prestige, and prepares the way to a
critical attitude and spirit towards it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
What is the actual worth of our valuations and tables of moral laws?
<i>What is the outcome of their dominion?</i> For whom? In relation to
what?&mdash;answer: for Life. But <i>what is Life?</i> A new and more definite
concept of what "Life" is, becomes necessary here. My formula of this
concept is: Life is Will to Power.</p>

<p><i>What is the meaning of the very act of valuing?</i> Does it point back to
another, metaphysical world, or does it point down? (As Kant believed,
who lived in a period which <i>preceded</i> the great historical movement.)
In short: <i>what is its origin?</i> Or had it no human "origin"?&mdash;Answer:
moral valuations are a sort of explanation, they constitute a method
of interpreting. Interpretation in itself is a symptom of definite
physiological conditions, as also of a definite spiritual level of
ruling judgments. <i>What is it that interprets?</i>&mdash;Our passions.</p>


<p class="parnum">255.</p>

<p>All virtues should be looked upon as physiological <i>conditions</i>: the
principal organic functions, more particularly, should be considered
necessary and good. All virtues are really refined <i>passions</i> and
elevated physiological conditions.</p>

<p>Pity and philanthropy may be regarded as the developments of
sexual relations,&mdash;justice as the development of the passion for
revenge,&mdash;virtue as the love of resistance, the will to power,&mdash;honour
as an acknowledgment of an equal, or of an equally powerful, force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">256.</p>

<p>Under "Morality" I understand a system of valuations which is in
relation with the conditions of a creature's life.</p>


<p class="parnum">257.</p>

<p>Formerly it was said of every form of morality, "Ye shall know them by
their fruits." I say of every form of morality: "It is a fruit, and
from it I learn the <i>Soil</i> out of which it grew."</p>


<p class="parnum">258.</p>

<p>I have tried to understand all moral judgments as symptoms and a
language of signs in which the processes of physiological prosperity
or the reverse, as also the consciousness of the conditions of
preservation and growth, are betrayed&mdash;a mode of interpretation equal
in worth to astrology, prejudices, created by instincts (peculiar
to races, communities, and different stages of existence, as, for
instance, youth or decay, etc.).</p>

<p>Applying this principle to the morality of Christian Europe more
particularly, we find that our moral values are signs of decline, of a
disbelief in <i>Life,</i> and of a preparation for pessimism.</p>

<p>My leading doctrine is this: <i>there are no moral phenomena, but only a
moral interpretation of phenomena. The origin of this interpretation
itself lies beyond the pale of morality.</i></p>

<p>What is the meaning of the fact that we have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>imagined a
<i>contradiction</i> in existence? This is of paramount importance: behind
all other valuations those moral valuations stand commandingly.
Supposing they disappear, according to what standard shall we then
measure? And then of what value would knowledge be, etc. etc.???</p>


<p class="parnum">259.</p>

<p>A point of view: in all valuations there is a definite purpose:
the <i>preservation</i> of an individual, a community, a race, a state,
a church, a belief, or a culture.&mdash;Thanks to the fact that people
<i>forget</i> that all valuing has a purpose, one and the same man may swarm
with a host of contradictory valuations, and <i>therefore with a host of
contradictory impulses.</i> This is the <i>expression of disease in man</i> as
opposed to the health of animals, in which all the instincts answer
certain definite purposes.</p>

<p>This creature full of contradictions, however, has in his being a grand
method of acquiring knowledge: he feels the pros and cons, he elevates
himself <i>to Justice</i>&mdash;that is to say, to the ascertaining of principles
<i>beyond the valuations good and evil.</i></p>

<p>The wisest man would thus be the <i>richest in contradictions,</i> he would
also be gifted with mental antennæ wherewith he could understand all
kinds of men; and with it all he would have his great moments, when all
the chords in his being would ring in <i>splendid unison</i>&mdash;the rarest of
<i>accidents</i> even in us! A sort of planetary movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">260.</p>

<p>"To will" is to will an object. But "object," as an idea, involves
a valuation. Whence do valuations originate? Is a permanent norm,
"pleasant or painful," their basis?</p>

<p>But in an incalculable number of cases we first of all <i>make</i> a thing
painful, by investing it with a valuation.</p>

<p>The compass of moral valuations: they play a part in almost every
mental impression. To us the world is <i>coloured</i> by them.</p>

<p>We have imagined the purpose and value of all things: owing to this
we possess an enormous fund of <i>latent power,</i> but the study of
<i>comparative</i> values teaches us that values which were actually opposed
to each other have been held in high esteem, and that there have been
<i>many</i> tables of laws (they could not, therefore, have been worth
anything <i>per se</i>).</p>

<p>The analysis of individual tables of laws revealed the fact that they
were framed (often very badly) as the <i>conditions of existence</i> for
limited groups of people, to ensure their maintenance.</p>

<p>Upon examining modern men, we found that there are a large number
of <i>very different</i> values to hand, and that they no longer contain
any creative power&mdash;the fundamental principle: "the condition of
existence" is now quite divorced from the moral values. It is much
more superfluous and not nearly so painful. It becomes an <i>arbitrary</i>
matter. Chaos.</p>

<p>Who creates <i>the goal</i> which stands above mankind <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>kind and above the
individual? Formerly morality was a <i>preservative</i> measure: but nobody
wants to <i>preserve</i> any longer, there is nothing to preserve. Thus we
are reduced to an <i>experimental morality,</i> each must <i>postulate</i> a goal
for himself.</p>


<p class="parnum">261.</p>

<p>What is the <i>criterion</i> of a moral action? (1) Its disinterestedness,
(2) its universal acceptation, etc. But this is parlour-morality. Races
must be studied and observed, and, in each case, the criterion must be
discovered, as also the thing it expresses: a belief such as: "This
particular attitude or behaviour belongs to the principal condition of
our existence." Immoral means "that which brings about ruin." Now all
societies in which these principles were discovered have met with their
ruin: a few of these principles have been used and used again, because
every newly established community required them; this was the case, for
instance, with "Thou shalt not steal." In ages when people could not be
expected to show any marked social instinct (as, for instance, in the
age of the Roman Empire) the latter was, religiously speaking, directed
towards the idea of "spiritual salvation," or, in philosophical
parlance, towards "the greatest happiness." For even the philosophers
of Greece did not feel any more for their πολις.</p>


<p class="parnum">262.</p>

<p><i>The necessity of false values.</i>&mdash;A judgment may be refuted when it is
shown that it was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>conditioned: but the necessity of retaining it is
not thereby cancelled. Reasons can no more eradicate false values than
they can alter astigmatism in a man's eyes.</p>

<p>The need of their <i>existence</i> must be understood: they are the <i>result</i>
of causes which have nothing to do with reasoning.</p>


<p class="parnum">263.</p>

<p>To <i>see</i> and <i>reveal</i> the problem of morality seems to me to be the new
task and the principal thing of all. I deny that this has been done by
moral philosophies heretofore.</p>


<p class="parnum">264.</p>

<p>How false and deceptive men have always been concerning the fundamental
facts of their inner world! Here to have no eye; here to hold one's
tongue, and here to open one's mouth.</p>


<p class="parnum">265.</p>

<p>There seems to be no knowledge or consciousness of the many
<i>revolutions</i> that have taken place in moral judgments, and of
the number of times that "evil" has really and seriously been
christened "good" and <i>vice versa.</i> I myself pointed to one of these
transformations with the words "Sittlichkeit der Sitte."<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Even

<p>A. <i>Morality</i> as the work of <i>Immorality.</i></p>

<p>1. In order that moral values may attain to <i>supremacy,</i> a host of

and considerations.</p>

Doubt, έποχή, Judging. The "Immorality" of <i>belief</i> in morality.</p>

<p>The steps:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Absolute dominion of morality: all biological phenomena measured and
<i>judged</i> according to its values.</p>

<p>2. The attempt to identify Life with morality (symptom of awakened
scepticism: morality must no longer be regarded as the opposite of
Life); many means are sought&mdash;even a transcendental one.</p>

<p>3. The <i>opposition of Life</i> and <i>Morality.</i> Morality condemned and
sentenced by Life.</p>

<p>D. To what extent was morality <i>dangerous</i> to Life?</p>

<p><i>(a)</i> It depreciated the joy of living and the gratitude felt towards
Life, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<i>(b)</i> It checked the tendency to beautify and to ennoble Life.</p>

<p><i>(c)</i> It checked the knowledge of Life.</p>

<p><i>(d)</i> It checked the unfolding of Life, because it tried to set the
highest phenomena thereof at variance with itself.</p>

<p>E. Contra-account: the <i>usefulness</i> of morality to Life.</p>

<p>(1) Morality may be a preservative measure for the general whole, it
may be a process of uniting dispersed members: it is useful as an agent
in the production of the man who is a "<i>tool</i>."</p>

<p>(2) Morality may be a preservative measure mitigating the inner danger
threatening man from the direction of his passions: it is useful to
"<i>mediocre people</i>."</p>

<p>(3) Morality may be a preservative measure resisting the life-poisoning
influences of profound sorrow and bitterness: it is useful to the
"<i>sufferers</i>."</p>

<p>(4) Morality may be a preservative measure opposed to the terrible
outbursts of the mighty: it is useful to the "<i>lowly</i>."</p>

<p class="parnum">267.</p>

<p>It is an excellent thing when one can use the expressions "right" and
"wrong" in a definite, narrow, and "bourgeois" sense, as for instance
in the sentence: "Do right and fear no one";<a name="FNanchor_4_11" id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_11" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;that is to say, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>do one's duty, according to the rough scheme of life within the limit
of which a community exists.&mdash;Let us not think meanly of what a few
thousand years of morality have inculcated upon our minds.</p>

<p>Two types of morality must not be confounded: the morality with which
the instinct that has remained healthy defends itself from incipient
decadence, and the other morality by means of which this decadence
asserts itself, justifies itself, and leads downwards.</p>

<p>The first-named is usually stoical, hard, tyrannical <i>(Stoicism</i> itself
was an example of the sort of "drag-chain" morality we speak of); the
other is gushing, sentimental, full of secrets, it has the women and
"beautiful feelings" on its side (Primitive Christianity was an example
of this morality).</p>


<p class="parnum">269.</p>

<p>I shall try to regard all moralising, with one glance, as a
phenomenon&mdash;also as a <i>riddle.</i> Moral phenomena have preoccupied me
like riddles. To-day I should be able to give a reply to the question:
why <i>should</i> my neighbour's welfare be of greater value to me than
my own? and why is it that my neighbour himself <i>should</i> value his
welfare differently from the way in which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>I value it&mdash;that is to say,
why should precisely <i>my</i> welfare be paramount in his mind? What is
the meaning of this "Thou shalt," which is regarded as "given" even by
philosophers themselves?</p>

<p>The seemingly insane idea that a man should esteem the act he performs
for a fellow-creature, higher than the one he performs for himself,
and that the same fellow-creature should do so too (that only those
acts should be held to be good which are performed with an eye to
the neighbour and for his welfare) has its reasons&mdash;namely, as the
result of the social instinct which rests upon the valuation, that
single individuals are of little importance although collectively
their importance is very great. This, of course, presupposes that they
constitute a <i>community</i> with one feeling and one conscience pervading
the whole. It is therefore a sort of exercise for keeping one's eyes in
a certain direction; it is the will to a kind of optics which renders a
view of one's self impossible.</p>

<p>My idea: goals are wanting, and <i>these must be individuals.</i> We see the
general drift: every individual gets sacrificed and serves as a tool.
Let any one keep his eyes open in the streets&mdash;is not every one he sees
a slave? Whither? What is the purpose of it all?</p>


<p class="parnum">270.</p>

<p>How is it possible that a man can respect himself <i>only</i> in regard
to moral values, that he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>subordinates and despises everything in
favour of good, evil, improvement, spiritual salvation, etc.? as,
for instance, Henri Fréd. Amiel. What is the meaning of the <i>moral
idiosyncrasy</i>?&mdash;I mean this both in the psychological and physiological
sense, as it was, for instance, in Pascal. In cases, then, in which
<i>other</i> great qualities are not wanting; and even in the case of
Schopenhauer, who obviously valued what he did not and <i>could</i> not have
...&mdash;is it not the result of a merely mechanical <i>moral interpretation</i>
of real states of pain and displeasure? is it not a particular form
of <i>sensibility</i> which does <i>not</i> happen to <i>understand</i> the cause
of its many unpleasurable feelings, but <i>thinks to explain them with
moral hypotheses?</i> In this way an occasional feeling of well-being and
<i>strength</i> always appears under the optics of a "clean conscience,"
flooded with light through the proximity of God and the consciousness
of salvation.... Thus the <i>moral idiosyncratist</i> has (1) <i>either</i>
acquired his real worth in approximating to the virtuous type of
society: "the good fellow," "<i>the upright man</i>"&mdash;a sort of medium
state of high respectability: <i>mediocre</i> in all his abilities,
but honest, conscientious, firm, respected, and tried, in all his
aspirations; (2) <i>or,</i> he imagines he has acquired that worth, simply
because he cannot otherwise understand all his states&mdash;he is unknown to
himself; he therefore interprets himself in this fashion.&mdash;Morality is
the only <i>scheme of interpretation</i> by means of which this type of man
can tolerate himself:&mdash;is it a form of vanity?</p>

<p><i>The predominance of moral values.</i>&mdash;The consequence of this
predominance: the corruption of psychology, etc.; the fatality which
is associated with it everywhere. What is the <i>meaning</i> of this
predominance? What does it point to?</p>

<p>To a certain <i>greater urgency</i> of saying nay or yea definitely in
this domain. All sorts of <i>imperatives</i> have been used in order to
make moral values appear as if they were for ever fixed:&mdash;they have
been enjoined for the longest period of time: they almost appear
to be instinctive, like inner commands. They are the expression of
<i>society's preservative measures,</i> for they are felt to be almost
<i>beyond question.</i> The practice&mdash;that is to say, the <i>utility</i> of being
agreed concerning superior values, has attained in this respect to
a sort of sanction. We observe that every care is taken to paralyse
reflection and criticism in this department&mdash;look at Kant's attitude!
not to speak of those who believe that it is immoral even to prosecute
"research" in these matters.</p>

<p><i>My desire</i> is to show the absolute homogeneity of all phenomena, and
to ascribe to moral differentiations but the value of <i>perspective</i>; to
show that all that which is praised as moral is essentially the same
as that which is immoral, and was only <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>made possible, according to
the law of all moral development&mdash;that is to say, by means of immoral
artifices and with a view to immoral ends&mdash;just as all that which
has been decried as immoral is, from the standpoint of economics,
both superior and essential; and how development leading to a greater
abundance of life necessarily Involves <i>progress</i> in the realm <i>of
immorality</i>. "Truth," that is the extent to which we <i>allow</i> ourselves
to comprehend <i>this</i> fact.</p>


<p class="parnum">273.</p>

<p>But do not let us fear: as a matter of fact, we require a great deal of
morality, in order to be immoral in this subtle way; let me speak in a
parable:&mdash;</p>

<p>A physiologist interested in a certain illness, and an invalid who
wishes to be cured of that same illness, have not the same interests.
Let us suppose that the illness happens to be morality,&mdash;for morality
is an illness,&mdash;and that we Europeans are the invalid: what an amount
of subtle torment and difficulty would arise supposing we Europeans
were, at once, our own inquisitive spectators and the physiologist
above-mentioned! Should we under these circumstances earnestly desire
to rid ourselves of morality? Should we want to? This is of course
irrespective of the question whether we should be <i>able</i> to do
so&mdash;whether we can be <i>cured</i> at all?</p>

<p class="title">2. The Herd.</p>


<p class="parnum">274.</p>

<p><i>Whose will to power is morality?</i>&mdash;The <i>common factor</i> of all European
history since the time of <i>Socrates</i> is the attempt to make the <i>moral
values</i> dominate all other values, in order that they should not be
only the leader and judge of life, but also: (1) knowledge, (2) Art,
(3) political and social aspirations. "Amelioration" regarded as the
only duty, everything else used as a <i>means</i> thereto (or as a force
distributing, hindering, and endangering its realisation, and therefore
to be opposed and annihilated ...).&mdash;A similar movement to be observed
<i>in China</i> and <i>India.</i></p>

<p>What is the meaning of this <i>will to power on the part of moral
values,</i> which has played such a part in the world's prodigious
evolutions?</p>

<p><i>Answer:&mdash;Three powers lie concealed behind it</i>; (1) The instinct
of the <i>herd</i> opposed to the strong and the independent; (2) the
instinct of all <i>sufferers</i> and all <i>abortions</i> opposed to the happy
and well-constituted; (3) the instinct of the mediocre opposed to
the exceptions.&mdash;<i>Enormous advantage of this movement,</i> despite the
cruelty, falseness, and narrow-mindedness which has helped it along
(for the history of the <i>struggle of morality with the fundamental
instincts of life</i> is in itself the greatest piece of immorality that
has ever yet been witnessed on earth ...).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">275.</p>


<p>The fewest succeed in discovering a problem behind all that which
constitutes our daily life, and to which we have become accustomed
throughout the ages&mdash;our eye does not seem focussed for such things:
at least, this seems to me to be the case in so far as our morality is
concerned.</p>

<p>"Every man should be the preoccupation of his fellows"; he who thinks
in this way deserves honour: no one ought to think of himself.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt": an impulse which, like the sexual impulse, cannot fathom
itself, is set apart and is not condemned as all the other instincts
are&mdash;on the contrary, it is made to be their standard and their judge!</p>

<p>The problem of "equality," in the face of the fact that we all thirst
for distinction: here, on the contrary, we should demand of ourselves
what we demand of others. That is so tasteless and obviously insane;
but&mdash;it is felt to be holy and of a higher order. The fact that it is
opposed to common sense is not even noticed.</p>

<p>Self-sacrifice and self-abnegation are considered distinguishing, as
are also the attempt to obey morality implicitly, and the belief that
one should be every one's equal in its presence.</p>

<p>The neglect and the surrender of Life and of well-being is held to be
distinguished, as are also the complete renunciation of individual
valuations and the severe exaction from every one of the same
sacrifice. "The value of an action is once <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>and for all <i>fixed</i>: every
individual must submit to this valuation."</p>

<p>We see: an authority speaks&mdash;who speaks?&mdash;We must condone it in human
pride, if man tried to make this authority as high as possible, for
he wanted to feel as humble as he possibly could by the side of it.
Thus&mdash;God speaks!</p>

<p>God was necessary as an unconditional sanction which has no superior,
as a "Categorical Imperator": or, in so far as people believed in the
authority of reason, what was needed was a "unitarian metaphysics" by
means of which this view could be made logical.</p>

<p>Now, admitting that faith in God is dead: the question arises once
more: "who speaks?" My answer, which I take from biology and not from
metaphysics, is: "the <i>gregarious instinct speaks.</i>" This is what
desires to be master: hence its "thou shalt!"&mdash;it will allow the
individual to exist only as a part of a whole, only in favour of the
whole, it hates those who detach themselves from everything&mdash;it turns
the hatred of all individuals against him.</p>


<p class="parnum">276.</p>

<p>The whole of the morality of Europe is based upon the values <i>which
are useful to the herd</i>: the sorrow of all higher and exceptional men
is explained by the fact that everything which distinguishes them from
others reaches their consciousness in the form of a feeling of their
own smallness and egregiousness. It is the <i>virtues</i> of modern men
which are the causes of pessimistic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>gloominess; the mediocre, like the
herd, are not troubled much with questions or with conscience&mdash;they
are cheerful. (Among the gloomy strong men, Pascal and Schopenhauer are
noted examples.)</p>

<p><i>The more dangerous a quality seems to the herd, the more completely it
is condemned.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">277.</p>

<p>The morality of <i>truthfulness</i> in the herd. "Thou shalt be
recognisable, thou shalt express thy inner nature by means of clear
and constant signs&mdash;otherwise thou art dangerous: and supposing
thou art evil, thy power of dissimulation is absolutely the worst
thing for the herd. We despise the secretive and those whom we
cannot identify.&mdash;<i>Consequently</i> thou must regard thyself as
recognisable, thou mayest not remain <i>concealed</i> from thyself, thou
mayest not even believe in the possibility of thy ever <i>changing</i>."
Thus, the insistence upon truthfulness has as its main object the
<i>recognisability</i> and the <i>stability</i> of the individual. As a matter
of fact, it is the object of education to make each gregarious
unit believe in a certain <i>definite dogma</i> concerning the nature
of man: education <i>first creates this dogma</i> and thereupon exacts
"truthfulness."</p>


<p class="parnum">278.</p>

<p>Within the confines of a herd or of a community&mdash;that is to say, <i>inter
pares,</i> the <i>over-estimation</i> of truthfulness is very reasonable. A
man <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>must not allow himself to be deceived&mdash;and <i>consequently</i> he
adopts as his own personal morality that he should deceive no one!&mdash;a
sort of mutual obligation among equals! In his dealings with the
outside world caution and danger demand that he should <i>be on his guard
against deception</i>: the first psychological condition of this attitude
would mean that he is also on his guard against <i>his own people.</i>
Mistrust thus appears as the source of truthfulness.</p>


<p class="parnum">279.</p>

<p><i>A criticism of the virtues of the herd.</i>&mdash;Inertia is active: (1)
In confidence, because mistrust makes suspense, reflection, and
observation necessary. (2) In veneration, where the gulf that
separates power is great and submission necessary: then, so that
fear may cease to exist, everybody tries to love and esteem, while
the difference in power is interpreted as a difference of value:
and thus the relationship to the powerful <i>no longer has anything
revolting in it.</i> (3) In the sense of truth. What is truth? Truth
is that explanation of things which causes us the smallest amount
of mental exertion (apart from this, lying is extremely fatiguing).
(4) In sympathy. It is a relief to know one's self on the same level
with all, to feel as all feel, and to <i>accept</i> a belief which is
already current; it is something passive beside the activity which
appropriates and continually carries into practice the most individual
rights of valuation (the latter process allows of no repose). (5) In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
impartiality and coolness of judgment: people scout the strain of being
moved, and prefer to be detached and "objective." (6) In uprightness:
people prefer to obey a law which is to hand rather than to <i>create</i>
a new one, rather than to command themselves and others: the fear of
commanding&mdash;it is better to submit than to rebel. (7) In toleration:
the fear of exercising a right or of enforcing a judgment.</p>


<p class="parnum">280.</p>

<p>The instinct of the herd values the <i>juste milieu</i> and the <i>average</i>
as the highest and most precious of all things: the spot where the
majority is to be found, and the air that it breathes there. In this
way it is the opponent of all order of rank; it regards a climb from
the level to the heights in the same light as a descent from the
majority to the minority. The herd regards the <i>exception,</i> whether
it be above or beneath its general level, as something which is
antagonistic and dangerous to itself. Their trick in dealing with
the exceptions above them, the strong, the mighty, the wise, and the
fruitful, is to persuade them to become guardians, herdsmen, and
watchmen&mdash;in fact, to become their <i>head-servants</i>: thus they convert
a danger into a thing which is useful. In the middle, fear ceases:
here a man is alone with nothing; here there is not much room even for
misunderstandings; here there is equality; here a man's individual
existence is not felt as a reproach, but as the <i>right</i> existence;
here <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>contentment reigns supreme. Mistrust is active only towards the
exceptions; to be an exception is to be a sinner.</p>


<p class="parnum">281.</p>



<p>If, in compliance with our communal instincts, we make certain
regulations for, ourselves and forbid certain acts, we do not of
course, in common reason, forbid a certain kind of "existence," nor
a certain attitude of mind, but only a particular application and
development of this "existence" and "attitude of mind." But then the
idealist of virtue, the <i>moralist,</i> comes along and says: "God sees
into the human heart! What matters it that ye abstain from certain
acts: ye are not any better on that account!" Answer: Mr. Longears
and Virtue-Monger, we do not want to be better at all, we are quite
satisfied with ourselves, all we desire is that we should not <i>harm</i>
one another&mdash;and that is why we forbid certain actions when they take
a particular direction&mdash;that is to say, when they are against our
own interests: but that does not alter the fact that when these same
actions are directed against the enemies of our community&mdash;against
you, for instance&mdash;we are at a loss to know how to pay them sufficient
honour. We educate our children up to them; we develop them to the
fullest extent. Did we share that "god-fearing" radicalism which your
holy craziness recommends, if we were green-horns enough to condemn
the source of those forbidden "acts" by condemning the "heart" and the
"attitude of mind" which recommends them, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>that would mean condemning
our very existence, and with it its greatest prerequisite&mdash;an attitude
of mind, a heart, a passion which we revere with all our soul. By
our decrees we prevent this attitude of mind from breaking out and
venting itself in a useless way&mdash;we are prudent when we prescribe
such laws for ourselves; we are also <i>moral</i> in so doing.... Have
you no idea&mdash;however vague&mdash;what sacrifices it has cost us, how much
self-control, self-subjection, and hardness it has compelled us to
exercise? We are vehement in our desires; there are times when we even
feel as if we could devour each other.... But the "communal spirit" is
master of us: have you observed that this is almost a definition of
morality?</p>


<p class="parnum">282.</p>

<p><i>The weakness of the gregarious animal</i> gives rise to a morality
which is precisely similar to that resulting from the weakness of the
decadent man: they understand each other; they <i>associate</i> with each
other (the great decadent religions always rely upon the support of
the herd). The gregarious animal, as such, is free from all morbid
characteristics, it is in itself an invaluable creature; but it is
incapable of taking any initiative; it must have a "leader"&mdash;the
priests understand this.... The state is not subtle, not secret
enough; the art of "directing consciences" slips its grasp. How is the
gregarious animal infected with illness by the priest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">283.</p>

<p><i>The hatred directed against the privileged in body and spirit</i>:
the revolt of the ugly and bungled souls against the beautiful, the
proud, and the cheerful. The weapons used: contempt of beauty, of
pride, of happiness: "There is no such thing as merit," "The danger is
enormous: it is right that one <i>should</i> tremble and feel ill at ease,"
"Naturalness is evil; it is right to oppose all that is natural&mdash;even
'reason'" (all that is antinatural is elevated to the highest place).</p>

<p>It is again the <i>priests</i> who exploit this condition, and who win the
"people" over to themselves. "The sinner" over whom there is more joy
in heaven than over "the just person." This is the struggle against
"paganism" (the pang of conscience, a measure for disturbing the
harmony of the soul).</p>

<p><i>The hatred of the mediocre</i> for the <i>exceptions,</i> and of the herd for
its independent members. (Custom actually regarded as "morality.") The
revulsion of feeling <i>against</i> "egotism": that only is worth anything
which is done "for another." "We are all equal";&mdash;against the love of
dominion, against "dominion" in general;&mdash;against privilege;&mdash;against
sectarians, free-spirits, and sceptics;&mdash;against philosophy (a
force opposing mechanical and automatic instincts); in philosophers
themselves&mdash;"the categorical imperative," the essential nature of
morality, "general and universal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">284.</p>

<p>The qualities and tendencies which are <i>praised</i>: peacefulness, equity,
moderation, modesty, reverence, respectfulness, bravery, chastity,
honesty, fidelity, credulity, rectitude, confidence, resignation,
pity, helpfulness, conscientiousness, simplicity, mildness, justice,
generosity, leniency, obedience, disinterestedness, freedom from envy,
good nature, industry.</p>

<p>We must ascertain to what extent <i>such qualities</i> are conditioned
as means to the attainment of certain desires and <i>ends</i> (often an
"<i>evil</i>" end); or as results of dominating passions (for instance,
<i>intellectuality</i>): or as the expressions of certain states of
need&mdash;that is to say, as <i>preservative measures</i> (as in the case of
citizens, slaves, women, etc.).</p>

<p>In short, every one of them is not <i>considered "good" for its own
sake,</i> but rather because it approximates to a standard prescribed
either by "society" or by the "herd," as a means to the ends of the
latter, as necessary for their preservation and enhancement, and also
as the result of an actual <i>gregarious instinct</i> in the individual;
these qualities are thus in the service of an instinct which is
<i>fundamentally different</i> from these <i>states of virtue.</i> For the herd
is <i>antagonistic, selfish, and pitiless</i> to the outside world; it is
full of a love of dominion and of feelings of mistrust, etc.</p>

<p>In the "herdsman" this <i>antagonism</i> comes to the <i>fore</i> he must have
qualities which are <i>the reverse of</i> those possessed by the herd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
The mortal enmity of the herd towards all <i>order of rank</i>: its
instinct is in favour of the <i>leveller</i> (Christ). Towards all <i>strong
individuals (the sovereigns)</i> it is hostile, unfair, intemperate,
arrogant, cheeky, disrespectful, cowardly, false, lying, pitiless,
deceitful, envious, revengeful.</p>


<p class="parnum">285.</p>

<p>My teaching is this, that the herd seeks to maintain and preserve one
type of man, and that it defends itself on two sides&mdash;that is to say,
against those which are decadents from its ranks (criminals, etc.), and
against those who rise superior to its dead level. The instincts of the
herd tend to a stationary state of society; they merely preserve. They
have no creative power.</p>

<p>The pleasant feelings of goodness and benevolence with which the just
man fills us (as opposed to the suspense and the fear to which the
great innovating man gives rise) are our own sensations of personal
security and equality: in this way the gregarious animal glorifies
the gregarious nature, and then begins to feel at ease. This judgment
on the part of the "comfortable" ones rigs itself out in the most
beautiful words&mdash;and thus "morality" is born. Let any one observe,
however, the <i>hatred of the herd</i> for all truthful men.</p>


<p class="parnum">286.</p>

<p>Let us not deceive ourselves! When a man hears the whisper of the moral
imperative in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>breast, as altruism would have him hear it, he
shows thereby that he belongs to the <i>herd.</i> When a man is conscious
of the opposite feelings,&mdash;that is to say, when he sees his danger and
his undoing in disinterested and unselfish actions,&mdash;then he does not
belong to the herd.</p>


<p class="parnum">287.</p>

<p>My philosophy aims at a new <i>order of rank: not</i> at an individualistic
morality.<a name="FNanchor_5_12" id="FNanchor_5_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_12" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The spirit of the herd should rule within the herd&mdash;but
not beyond it: the leaders of the herd require a fundamentally
different valuation for their actions, as do also the independent ones
or the beasts of prey, etc.</p>

<p class="title">3. General Observations Concerning Morality.</p>


<p class="parnum">288.</p>

<p><i>Morality regarded as an attempt at establishing human pride.</i>&mdash;The
"Free-Will" theory is anti-religious. Its ultimate object is to bestow
the right upon man to regard himself as the <i>cause</i> of his highest
states and actions: it is a form of the growing <i>feeling of pride.</i></p>

<p>Man feels his power his "happiness"; as they say: there must be a will
behind these states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>&mdash;otherwise they do not belong to him. Virtue is
an attempt at postulating a modicum of will, past or present, as the
necessary antecedent to every exalted and strong feeling of happiness:
if the will to certain actions is regularly present in consciousness,
a sensation of power may be interpreted as its result. This is a
<i>merely psychological point of view,</i> based upon the false assumption
that nothing belongs to us which we have not consciously willed. The
whole of the teaching of responsibility relies upon the ingenuous
psychological rule that the will is the only cause, and that one must
have been aware of having willed in order to be able to regard <i>one's
self</i> as a cause.</p>

<p><i>Then comes the counter-movement</i>&mdash;that of the moral-philosophers.
These men still labour under the delusion that a man is responsible
only for what he has willed. The value of man is then made a <i>moral
value</i>: thus morality becomes a <i>causa prima</i>; for this there must be
some kind of principle in man, and "free will" is posited as <i>prima
causa.</i> The <i>arrière pensée</i> is always this: If man is not a <i>causa
prima</i> through his will, he must be irresponsible,&mdash;therefore he
does not come within the jurisdiction of morals,&mdash;virtue or vice is
automatic and mechanical....</p>

<p>In short: in order that man may respect himself he must be capable of
becoming evil.</p>


<p class="parnum">289.</p>

<p><i>Theatricalness</i> regarded as the result of "Free Will" morality. It
is a step in the <i>development <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>of the feeling of power itself</i> to
believe one's self to be the author of one's exalted moments (of one's
perfection) and to have <i>willed</i> them....</p>

<p>(Criticism: all perfect action is precisely unconscious and not
deliberate; consciousness is often the expression of an imperfect
and often morbid constitution. <i>Personal perfection regarded as
determined by will, as an act of consciousness,</i> as reason with
dialectics, is a caricature, a sort of self-contradiction.... Any
degree of consciousness renders perfection <i>impossible.</i> ... A form of
<i>theatricalness</i>.)</p>



<p class="parnum">290.</p>

<p>The <i>moral hypothesis,</i> designed with a view to <i>justifying God,</i>
said: evil must be voluntary (simply in order that the <i>voluntariness
of goodness</i> might be believed in); and again, all evil and suffering
have an <i>object which is salvation</i>.</p>

<p>The notion "guilt" was considered as something which had no
connection at all with the ultimate cause of existence, and the
notion "punishment" was held to be an educating and beneficent act,
consequently an act proceeding from a <i>good</i> God.</p>

<p>The absolute dominion of moral valuations <i>over</i> all others: nobody
doubted that God could not be evil and could do no harm&mdash;that is to
say, perfection was understood merely as <i>moral</i> perfection.</p>


<p class="parnum">291.</p>

<p>How false is the supposition that an action must depend upon what has
preceded it in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>consciousness! And morality has been measured in the
light of this supposition, as also criminality....</p>

<p>The value of an action must be judged by its results, say the
utilitarians: to measure it according to its origin involves the
impossibility of <i>knowing</i> that origin.</p>

<p>But do we know its results? Five stages ahead, perhaps. Who can tell
what an action provokes and sets in motion? As a stimulus? As the spark
which fires a powder-magazine? Utilitarians are simpletons.... And
finally, they would first of all have to know <i>what</i> is useful; here
also their sight can travel only over five stages or so.... They have
no notion of the great economy which cannot dispense with evil.</p>

<p>We do not know the origin or the results: has an action, then, any
value?</p>

<p>We have yet the action itself to consider: the states of consciousness
that accompany it, the yea or nay which follows upon its performance:
does the value of an action lie in the subjective states which
accompany it? (In that case, the value of music would be measured
according to the pleasure or displeasure which it occasions in us ...
which it gives to the <i>composer.</i> ...) Obviously feelings of value
must accompany it, a sensation of power, restraint, or impotence&mdash;for
instance, freedom or lightsomeness. Or, putting the question
differently: could the value of an action be reduced to physiological
terms? could it be the expression of completely free or constrained
life?&mdash;Maybe its <i>biological</i> value is expressed in this way....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
If, then, an action can be judged neither in the light of its origin,
nor its results, nor its accompaniments in consciousness, then its
value must be <i>x</i> unknown....</p>


<p class="parnum">292.</p>

<p>It amounts to a <i>denaturalisation of morality,</i> to <i>separate</i> an action
from a man; to direct hatred or contempt against "sin"; to believe that
there are actions which are good or bad in themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>re-establishment of</i> "<i>Nature</i>": an action in itself is quite
devoid of value; the whole question is this: who performed it? One and
the same "crime" may, in one case, be the greatest privilege, in the
other infamy. As a matter of fact, it is the selfishness of the judges
which interprets an action (in regard to its author) according as to
whether it was useful or harmful to themselves (or in relation to its
degree of likeness or unlikeness to them).</p>


<p class="parnum">293.</p>

<p>The concept "reprehensible action" presents us with some difficulties.
Nothing in all that happens can be reprehensible in itself: <i>one would
not dare to eliminate it completely</i>; for everything is so bound up
with everything else, that to exclude one part would mean to exclude
the whole.</p>

<p>A reprehensible action, therefore, would mean a reprehensible world as
a whole....</p>

<p>And even then, in a reprehensible world even reprehending would be
reprehensible.... And the consequence of an attitude of mind that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
condemns everything, would be the affirmation of everything in
practice.... If Becoming is a huge ring, everything that forms a part
of it is of equal value, is eternal and necessary.&mdash;In all correlations
of yea and nay, of preference and rejection, love and hate, all that
is expressed is a certain point of view, peculiar to the interests of
a certain type of living organism: everything that lives says <i>yea</i> by
the very fact of its existence.</p>


<p class="parnum">294.</p>

<p><i>Criticism of the subjective feelings of value.&mdash;</i>Conscience. Formerly
people argued: conscience condemns this action, therefore this action
is reprehensible. But, as a matter of fact, conscience condemns an
action because that action has been condemned for a long period of
time: all conscience does is to imitate. It does not create values.
That which first led to the condemnation of certain actions, was
<i>not</i> conscience: but the knowledge of (or the prejudice against)
its consequences.... The approbation of conscience, the feeling of
well-being, of "inner peace," is of the same order of emotions as the
artist's joy over his work&mdash;it proves nothing.... Self-contentment
proves no more in favour of that which gives rise to it, than its
absence can prove anything against the value of the thing which fails
to give rise to it. We are far too ignorant to be able to judge of the
value of our actions: in this respect we lack the ability to regard
things objectively. Even when we condemn an action, we do not do so
as judges, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>but as adversaries.... When noble sentiments accompany an
action, they prove nothing in its favour: an artist may present us
with an absolutely insignificant thing, though he be in the throes of
the most exalted pathos during its production. It were wiser to regard
these sentiments as misleading: they actually beguile our eye and our
power, away from criticism, from caution and from suspicion, and the
result often is that we make <i>fools</i> of ourselves ... they actually
make fools of us.</p>


<p class="parnum">295.</p>

<p>We are heirs to the conscience-vivisection and self-crucifixion of two
thousand years: in these two practices lie perhaps our longest efforts
at becoming perfect, our mastery, and certainly our subtlety; we have
affiliated natural propensities with a heavy conscience.</p>

<p>An attempt to produce an entirely opposite state of affairs would be
possible: that is to say, to affiliate all desires of a beyond, all
sympathy with things which are opposed to the senses, the intellect,
and nature&mdash;in fact, all the ideals that have existed hitherto (which
were all anti-worldly), with a heavy conscience.</p>


<p class="parnum">296.</p>

<p>The great <i>crimes</i> in <i>psychology</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That all <i>pain</i> and <i>unhappiness</i> should have been falsified by
being associated with what is wrong (guilt). (Thus pain was robbed of
its innocence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
(2) That all <i>strong emotions</i> (wantonness, voluptuousness, triumph,
pride, audacity, knowledge, assurance, and happiness in itself) were
branded as sinful, as seductive, and as suspicious.</p>

<p>(3) That <i>feelings of weakness,</i> inner acts of cowardice, lack of
personal courage, should have decked themselves in the most beautiful
words, and have been taught as desirable in the highest degree.</p>

<p>(4) That <i>greatness</i> in man should have been given the meaning of
disinterestedness, self-sacrifice for another's good, for other people;
that even in the scientist and the artist, the <i>elimination of the
individual personality</i> is presented as the cause of the greatest
knowledge and ability.</p>

<p>(5) That <i>love</i> should have been twisted round to mean submission
(and altruism), whereas it is in reality an act of appropriation or
of bestowal, resulting in the last case from a superabundance in the
wealth of a given personality. Only the <i>wholest</i> people can love; the
disinterested ones, the "objective" ones, are the worst lovers (just
ask the girls!). This principle also applies to the love of God or of
the "home country": a man must be able to rely absolutely upon himself.
(Egotism may be regarded as the <i>pre-eminence of the ego,</i> altruism as
the <i>pre-eminence of others</i>.)</p>

<p>(6) Life regarded as a punishment (happiness as a means of seduction);
the passions regarded as devilish; confidence in one's self as godless.</p>

<p><i>The whole of psychology is a psychology of obstacles,</i> a sort of
<i>barricade</i> built out of fear; on the one hand we find the masses (the
botched and bungled, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>the mediocre) defending themselves, by means of
it, against the <i>strong</i> (and finally <i>destroying</i> them in their growth
...); on the other hand, we find all the instincts with which these
classes are best able to prosper, sanctified and alone held in honour
by them. Let anyone examine the Jewish priesthood.</p>


<p class="parnum">297.</p>

<p><i>The vestiges of the depreciation of Nature</i> through moral
transcendence: The value of disinterestedness, the cult of altruism;
the belief in a reward in the play of natural consequences; the belief
in "goodness" and in genius itself, as if the one, like the other,
were the <i>result of disinterestedness</i>; the continuation of the
Church's sanction of the life of the citizen; the absolutely deliberate
misunderstanding of history (as a means of educating up to morality)
or pessimism in the attitude taken up towards history (the latter
is just as much a result of the depreciation of Nature, as is that
<i>pseudo-justification</i> of history, that refusal to see history as the
pessimist <i>sees</i> it).</p>


<p class="parnum">298.</p>

<p>"<i>Morality for its own sake</i>"&mdash;this is an important step in the
denaturalisation of morals: in itself it appears as a final value. In
this phase religion has generally become saturated with it: as, for
instance, in the case of Judaism. It likewise goes through a phase in
which it <i>separates itself from</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>religion, and in which no God is
"moral" enough for it: it then prefers the impersonal ideal.... This is
how the case stands at present.</p>

<p>"<i>Art for Art's sake</i>": this is a similarly dangerous principle: by
this means a false contrast is lent to things&mdash;it culminates in the
slander of reality ("idealising" <i>into the hateful</i>). When an ideal
is severed from reality, the latter is debased, impoverished, and
calumniated. <i>"Beauty for Beauty's sake," "Truth for Truth's sake,"
"Goodness for Goodness' sake"</i>&mdash;these are three forms of the evil eye
for reality.</p>

<p><i>Art, knowledge, and morality</i> are <i>means</i>: instead of recognising a
life-promoting tendency in them, they have been associated with the
<i>opposite of Life</i>&mdash;with "<i>God</i>"&mdash;they have also been regarded as
revelations of a higher world, which here and there transpires through
them....</p>

<p>"<i>Beautiful</i>" and "<i>ugly</i>," "<i>true</i>" and "<i>false</i>," "<i>good</i>" and
"<i>evil</i>"&mdash;these things are <i>distinctions</i> and <i>antagonisms</i> which
betray the preservative and promotive measures of Life, not necessarily
of man alone, but of all stable and enduring organisms which take up a
definite stand against their opponents. The <i>war</i> which thus ensues is
the essential factor: it is a means of <i>separating</i> things, <i>leading to
stronger</i> isolation....</p>

<i>natural immorality,</i> to natural "utility," etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may designate the tendency of these observations by the term
<i>moral naturalism</i>: my object is to re-translate the moral values which
have apparently become independent and <i>unnatural</i> into their real
nature&mdash;that is to say, into their natural "<i>immorality</i>."</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Refer to Jewish "holiness" and its natural basis. The case is

emancipated from its real <i>feature</i> (until it is almost the <i>opposite</i>
of Nature).</p>

<p>The stages in the <i>denaturalisation of morality</i> (or so-called
"<i>Idealisation</i>"):&mdash;</p>

<p>First it is a road to individual happiness,</p>

<p>then it is the result of knowledge,</p>

<p>then it is a Categorical Imperative,</p>

<p>then it is a way to Salvation,</p>

<p>then it is a denial of the will to live.</p>

<p>Why are not human values once more deposited nicely in the rut to

a philosopher to admire even this "nothing" (<i>Nil admirari</i>).</p>

<p>Man, a small species of very excitable animals,

matter of a moment, an incident, an exception that has no consequence,
something which is of no importance whatever to the general character
of the earth; the earth itself is, like every star, a hiatus between
two nonentities, an event without a plan, without reason, will, or
self-consciousness&mdash;the worst kind of necessity&mdash;<i>foolish</i> necessity....
Something in us rebels against this view; the serpent vanity whispers
to our hearts, "All this must be false because it is revolting....

<p class="title">4. How Virtue Is Made to Dominate.</p>


<p class="parnum">304.</p>

<p><i>Concerning the ideal of the moralist.</i>&mdash;In this treatise we wish to
speak of the great <i>politics</i> of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>virtue. We wrote it for the use of
all those who are interested, not so much in the process of becoming
virtuous as in that of making others virtuous&mdash;in how virtue <i>is made
to dominate.</i> I even intend to prove that in order to desire this
one thing&mdash;the dominion of virtue&mdash;the other must be systematically
avoided; that is to say, one must renounce all hopes of becoming
virtuous. This sacrifice is great: but such an end is perhaps a
sufficient reward for such a sacrifice. And even greater sacrifices!...
And some of the most famous moralists have risked as much. For these,
indeed, had already recognised and anticipated the truth which is to
be revealed for the first time in this treatise: that the <i>dominion of
virtue</i> is absolutely attainable <i>only by the use of the same means</i>
which are employed in the attainment of any other dominion, in any case
not <i>by</i> means of virtue itself....</p>

<p>As I have already said, this treatise deals with the politics of
virtue: it postulates an ideal of these politics; it describes it as it
ought to be, if anything at all can be perfect on this earth. Now, no
philosopher can be in any doubt as to what the type of perfection is
in politics; it is, of course, Machiavellianism. But Machiavellianism
which is <i>pur, sans mélange, cru, vert, dans toute sa force, dans
toute son âpreté,</i> is superhuman, divine, transcendental, and can
never be achieved by man&mdash;the most he can do is to approximate it.
Even in this narrower kind of politics&mdash;in the politics of virtue&mdash;the
ideal never seems to have been realised. Plato, too, only bordered
upon it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>Granted that one have eyes for concealed things, one can
discover, even in the most guileless and most conscious <i>moralists</i>
(and this is indeed the name of these moral politicians and of the
founders of all newer moral forces), traces showing that they too paid
their tribute to human weakness. <i>They all aspired</i> to virtue on their
own account&mdash;at least in their moments of weariness; and this is the
leading and most capital error on the part of any moralist&mdash;whose duty
it is to be an <i>immoralist in deeds.</i> That he must not exactly <i>appear
to be the latter,</i> is another matter. Or rather it is <i>not</i> another
matter: systematic self-denial of this kind (or, expressed morally:
dissimulation) belongs to, and is part and parcel of, the moralist's
canon and of his self-imposed duties: without it he can never attain
to his particular kind of perfection. Freedom from morality <i>and from
truth</i> when enjoyed for that purpose which rewards every sacrifice: for
the sake of making <i>morality dominate</i>&mdash;that is the canon. Moralists
are in need of the <i>attitudes of virtue,</i> as also of the attitudes of
truth; their error begins when they <i>yield</i> to virtue, when they lose
control of virtue, when they themselves become <i>moral</i> or <i>true.</i> A
great moralist is, among other things, necessarily a great actor; his
only danger is that his pose may unconsciously become a second nature,
just like his ideal, which is to keep his <i>esse</i> and his <i>operari</i>
apart in a divine way; everything he does must be done <i>sub specie
boni</i>&mdash;a lofty, remote, and exacting ideal! A <i>divine</i> ideal! And, as
a matter of fact, they say that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>the moralist thus imitates a model
which is no less than God Himself: God, the greatest Immoralist in
deeds that exists, but who nevertheless understands how to remain what
He <i>is,</i> the <i>good</i> God....</p>


<p class="parnum">305.</p>

<p>The dominion of virtue is not established by means of virtue itself;
with virtue itself, one renounces power, one loses the Will to Power.</p>


<p class="parnum">306.</p>

<p>The victory of a moral ideal is achieved by the same "immoral" means as
any other victory: violence, lies, slander, injustice.</p>


<p class="parnum">307.</p>

<p>He who knows the way fame originates will be suspicious even of the
fame virtue enjoys.</p>


<p class="parnum">308.</p>

<p>Morality is just as "immoral" as any other thing on earth; morality is
in itself a form of immorality.</p>

<p>The great <i>relief</i> which this conviction brings. The contradiction
between things disappears, the unity of all phenomena is <i>saved&mdash;&mdash;</i></p>


<p class="parnum">309.</p>

<p>There are some who actually go in search of what is immoral. When they
say: "this is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>wrong," they believe it ought to be done away with
or altered. On the other hand, I do not rest until I am quite clear
concerning the <i>immorality</i> of any particular thing which happens to
come under my notice. When I discover it, I recover my equanimity.</p>


<p class="parnum">310.</p>


<p>A. <i>The ways which lead to power</i>: the presentation of the new virtue
under the name of an <i>old</i> one,&mdash;the awakening of "interest" concerning
it ("happiness" declared to be its reward, and <i>vice versâ</i>),&mdash;artistic
slandering of all that stands in its way,&mdash;the exploitation of
advantages and accidents with the view of glorifying it,&mdash;the
conversion of its adherents into fanatics by means of sacrifices and
separations,&mdash;symbolism <i>on a grand scale</i>.</p>

<p>B. <i>Power attained</i>: (1) Means of constraint of virtue; (2) seductive
means of virtue; (3) the (court) etiquette of virtue.</p>


<p class="parnum">311.</p>


<p><i>By what means does a virtue attain to power?&mdash;</i>With precisely the
same means as a political party: slander, suspicion, the undermining of
opposing virtues that happen to be already in power, the changing of
their names, systematic persecution and scorn; in short, <i>by means of
acts of general "immorality."</i></p>

<p>How does a <i>desire</i> behave towards itself in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>order to become a
<i>virtue</i>?&mdash;A process of rechristening; systematic denial of its
intentions; practice in misunderstanding itself; alliance with
established and recognised virtues; ostentatious enmity towards its
adversaries. If possible, too, the protection of sacred powers must be
purchased; people must also be intoxicated and fired with enthusiasm;
idealistic humbug must be used, and a party must be won, which <i>either</i>
triumphs <i>or</i> perishes&mdash;one must be <i>unconscious and naïf</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">312.</p>

<p>Cruelty has become transformed and elevated into tragic pity, so that
we no longer recognise it as such. The same has happened to the love
of the sexes which has become amour-passion; the slavish attitude of
mind appears as Christian obedience; wretchedness becomes humility;
the disease of the <i>nervus sympathicus,</i> for instance, is eulogised as
Pessimism, Pascalism, or Carlylism, etc.</p>


<p class="parnum">313.</p>

<p>We should begin to entertain doubts concerning a man if we heard that
he required reasons in order to remain respectable: we should, in any
case, certainly avoid his society. The little word "for" in certain
cases may be compromising; sometimes a single "for" is enough to
refute one. If we should hear, in course of time, that such-and-such
an aspirant for virtue was in need of <i>bad</i> reasons in order to remain
respectable, it would not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>conduce to increasing our respect for him.
But he goes further; he comes to us, and tells us quite openly: "You
disturb my morality, with your disbelief, Mr. Sceptic; so long as you
cannot believe in my <i>bad reasons,</i>&mdash;that is to say, in my God, in a
disciplinary Beyond, in free will, etc.,&mdash;you put obstacles in the way
of my virtue.... Moral, sceptics must be suppressed: they prevent the
<i>moralisation of the masses</i>."</p>


<p class="parnum">314.</p>

<p>Our most sacred convictions, those which are permanent in us concerning
the highest values, are <i>judgments emanating from our muscles.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">315.</p>

<p><i>Morality in the valuation of races and classes.&mdash;</i>In view of the fact
that the <i>passions</i> and <i>fundamental instincts</i> in every race and class
express the means which enable the latter to preserve themselves (or at
least the means which have enabled them to live for the longest period
of time), to call them "virtuous" practically means:</p>

<p>That they change their character, shed their skins, and blot out their
past.</p>

<p>It means that they should cease from differentiating themselves from
others.</p>

<p>It means that they are getting to resemble each other in their needs
and aspirations&mdash;or, more exactly, <i>that they are declining....</i></p>

<p>It means that the will to one kind of morality <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>is merely the <i>tyranny</i>
of the particular species, which is adapted to that kind of morality,
over other species: it means a process of annihilation or general
levelling in favour of the prevailing species (whether it be to
render the non-prevailing species harmless, or to exploit them); the
"Abolition of Slavery"&mdash;a so-called tribute to "human dignity"; in
truth, the <i>annihilation</i> of a fundamentally different species (the
undermining of its values and its happiness).</p>

<p>The qualities which constitute the strength of an <i>opposing race</i> or
class are declared to be the most evil and pernicious things it has:
for by means of them it may be harmful to us (its virtues are slandered
and rechristened).</p>

<p>When a man or a people harm us, their action constitutes an objection
against them: but from their point of view we are desirable, because we
are such as can be useful to them.</p>

<p>The insistence upon spreading "humaneness" (which guilelessly starts
out with the assumption that it is in possession of the formula "What
is human") is all humbug, beneath the cover of which a certain definite
type of man strives to attain to power: or, more precisely, a very
particular kind of instinct&mdash;the <i>gregarious instinct.</i> "The equality
of men": this is what lies <i>concealed</i> behind the tendency of <i>making</i>
ever more and more men <i>alike</i> as men.</p>

<p><i>The "interested nature" of the morality of ordinary people.</i> (The
trick was to elevate the great passions for power and property to the
positions of protectors of virtue.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
To what extent do all kinds of <i>business men</i> and money-grabbers&mdash;all
those who give and take credit&mdash;find it <i>necessary</i> to promote the
levelling of all characters and notions of value? the <i>commerce and the
exchange of the world</i> leads to, and almost purchases, virtue.</p>

<p>The <i>State</i> exercises the same influence, as does also any sort of
ruling power at the head of officials and soldiers; <i>science</i> acts in
the same way, in order that it may work in security and economise its
forces. And the <i>priesthood</i> does the same.</p>

<p>Communal morality is thus promoted here, because it is advantageous;
and, in order to make it triumph, war and violence are waged against
immorality&mdash;with what "right"? Without any right whatsoever; but in
accordance with the instinct of self-preservation. The same classes
avail themselves of immorality when it serves their purpose to do so.</p>


<p class="parnum">316.</p>

<p>Observe the hypocritical colour which all <i>civil institutions</i> are
painted, just as if they were <i>the offshoots of morality</i>&mdash;for
instance: marriage, work, calling, patriotism, the family, order,
and rights. But as they were all established in favour of the <i>most
mediocre</i> type of man, to protect him from exceptions and the need of
exceptions, one must not be surprised to find them sown with lies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Virtue</i> must be defended against its preachers: they are its worst
enemies. For they teach virtue as an ideal <i>for all</i>; they divest
virtue of the charm which consists in its rareness, its inimitableness,
its exceptional and non-average character&mdash;that is to say, of its
<i>aristocratic charm.</i> A stand must also be made against those
embittered idealists who eagerly tap all pots and are satisfied to
hear them ring hollow: what ingenuousness&mdash;to <i>demand</i> great and rare
things, and then to declare, with anger and contempt of one's fellows,
that they do not exist!&mdash;It is obvious, for instance, that a <i>marriage</i>
is worth only as much as those are worth whom it joins&mdash;that is to say,
that on the whole it is something wretched and indecent: no priest or
registrar can make anything else of it.</p>

<p><i>Virtue</i><a name="FNanchor_6_13" id="FNanchor_6_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_13" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has all the instincts of the average man against it: it is
not profitable, it is not prudent, and it isolates. It is related to
passion, and not very accessible to reason; it spoils the character,
the head, and the senses&mdash;always, of course, subject to the medium
standard of men; it provokes hostility towards order, and towards the
<i>lies</i> which are concealed beneath all order, all institutions, and
all reality&mdash;when seen in the light of its pernicious influence upon
<i>others,</i> it is <i>the worst of vices</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
I recognise virtue in that: (1) it does not insist upon being
recognised; (2) it does not presuppose the existence of virtue
everywhere, but precisely something else; (3) it does <i>not suffer</i>
from the absence of virtue, but regards it rather as a relation of
perspective which throws virtue into relief: it does not proclaim
itself; (4) it makes no propaganda; (5) it allows no one to pose as
judge because it is always a <i>personal</i> virtue; (6) it does precisely
what is generally <i>forbidden</i>: virtue as I understand it is the actual
<i>vetitum</i> within all gregarious legislation; (7) in short, I recognise
virtue in that it is in the Renaissance style&mdash;<i>virtù</i>&mdash;free from all
moralic acid....</p>

all, were never such donkeys of virtue: their inmost instinct, that
which determined their quantum of power, did not find its reckoning
thus: whereas with your minimum amount of power nothing can seem more
full of wisdom to you than virtue. But the <i>multitude</i> are on your

<p>A <i>virtuous man</i> is of a lower species because, in the first place,
he has no "personality," but acquires his value by conforming with a
certain human scheme which has been once and for ever fixed. He has no
independent value: he may be compared; he has his equals, he <i>must</i> not
be an individual.</p>

<p>Reckoning up the qualities of the <i>good</i> man, why is it they appear
pleasant to us? Because they urge us neither to war, to mistrust, to
caution, to the accumulating of forces, nor to severity: our laziness,
our good nature, and our levity, have a <i>good time.</i> This, our <i>feeling

<p>Under certain circumstances, virtue is merely a venerable form of
stupidity: who could blame you for it? And this form of virtue has not
been outlived even to-day. A sort of honest peasant-simplicity, which
is possible, however, in all classes of society, and which one cannot
meet with anything else than a respectful smile, still thinks to-day
that everything is in good hands&mdash;that is to say, in "God's hands": and
when it supports this proposition with that same modest assurance as
that with which it would assert that two and two are four, we others
naturally refrain from contradiction.</p>

<p>Why disturb <i>this</i> pure foolery? Why darken it with our cares
concerning man, people, goals, the future? Even if we wished to
do so, we shouldn't succeed. <i>In</i> all things these people see the
reflection of their own venerable stupidity and goodness (in them the
old God&mdash;<i>deus myops&mdash;</i> still lives); we others see something else in
everything: our problematic nature, our contradictions, our deeper,
more painful, and more suspicious wisdom.</p>


<p class="parnum">321.</p>

<p>He who finds a particular virtue an easy matter, ultimately laughs at
it. Seriousness cannot be maintained once virtue is attained. As soon
as a man has reached virtue, he jumps out of it&mdash;whither? Into devilry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how intelligent all our evil tendencies <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>and impulses have
become! What an amount of inquisitiveness torments them! They are all
fishhooks of knowledge!</p>


<p class="parnum">322.</p>

<p>The idea is to associate vice with something so terrible that at
last one is obliged to run away from it in order to be rid of its
associations. This is the well-known case of Tannhäuser. Tannhäuser,
brought to his wits' end by Wagnerian music, cannot endure life any
longer even in the company of Mrs. Venus: suddenly virtue begins to
have a charm for him; a Thuringian virgin goes up in price, and what
is even worse still, he shows a liking for Wolfram von Eschenbach's
melody....</p>


<p class="parnum">323.</p>

<p><i>The Patrons of Virtue.</i>&mdash;Lust of property, lust of power, laziness,
simplicity, fear; all these things are interested in virtue; that is
why it stands so securely.</p>


<p class="parnum">324.</p>

<p><i>Virtue</i> is no longer believed in; its powers of attraction are dead;
what is needed is some one who will once more bring it into the market
in the form of an outlandish kind of adventure and of dissipation. It
exacts too much extravagance and narrow-mindedness from its believers
to allow of conscience not being against it to-day. Certainly, for
people, without either consciences or scruples, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>this may constitute
its new charm: it is now what it has never been before&mdash;a vice.</p>


<p class="parnum">325.</p>

<p>Virtue is still the most expensive vice: <i>let</i> it remain so!</p>


<p class="parnum">326.</p>

<p>Virtues are as dangerous as vices, in so far as they are allowed to
rule over one as authorities and laws coming from outside, and not as
qualities one develops one's self. The latter is the only right way;
they should be the most personal means of defence and most individual
needs&mdash;the determining factors of precisely <i>our</i> existence and growth,
which we recognise and acknowledge independently of the question
whether others grow with us with the help of the same or of different
principles. This view of the danger of the virtue which is understood
as impersonal and <i>objective</i> also holds good of modesty: through
modesty many of the choicest intellects perish. The morality of modesty
is the worst possible softening influence for those souls for which it
is pre-eminently necessary that they become <i>hard</i> betimes.</p>


<p class="parnum">327.</p>

<p>The domain of morality must be reduced and limited step by step; the
names of the instincts which are really active in this sphere must be
drawn into the light of day and honoured, after <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> have lain all
this time in the concealment of hypocritical names of virtue. Out of
respect for one's "honesty," which makes itself heard ever more and
more imperiously, one ought to unlearn the shame which makes one deny
and "explain away" all natural instincts. The extent to which one can
dispense with virtue is the measure of one's strength; and a height may
be imagined where the notion "virtue" is understood in such a way as
to be reminiscent of <i>virtù</i>&mdash;the virtue of the Renaissance&mdash;free from
moralic acid. But for the moment&mdash;how remote this ideal seems!</p>

<p><i>The reduction of the domain of morality</i> is a sign of its progress.
Wherever, hitherto, thought has not been guided by causality, thinking
has taken a <i>moral</i> turn.</p>


<p class="parnum">328.</p>

<p>After all, what have I achieved? Let us not close our eyes to this
wonderful result: I have lent new <i>charms</i> to virtue&mdash;it now affects
one in the same way as something <i>forbidden.</i> It has our most subtle
honesty against it, it is salted in the "<i>cum grano salis</i>" of the
scientific pang of conscience. It savours of antiquity and of old
fashion, and thus it is at last beginning to draw refined people and
to make them inquisitive&mdash;in short, it affects us like a vice. Only
after we have once recognised that everything consists of lies and
appearance, shall we have again earned the right to uphold this most
beautiful of all fictions&mdash;virtue. There will then remain no further
reason to deprive ourselves of it: only when we have shown <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>virtue to
be a <i>form of immorality</i> do we again <i>justify it,</i>&mdash;it then becomes
classified, and likened, in its fundamental features, to the profound
and general immorality of all existence, of which it is then shown to
be a part. It appears as a form of luxury of the first order, the most
arrogant, the dearest, and rarest form of vice. We have robbed it of
its grimaces and divested it of its drapery; we have delivered it from
the importunate familiarity of the crowd; we have deprived it of its
ridiculous rigidity, its empty expression, its stiff false hair, and
its hieratic muscles.</p>


<p class="parnum">329.</p>

<p>And is it supposed that I have thereby done any harm to virtue?... Just
as little as anarchists do to princes. Only since they have been shot
at, have they once more sat securely on their thrones.... For thus
it has always been and will ever be: one cannot do a thing a better
service than to persecute it and to run it to earth.... This&mdash;I have
done.</p>

<p class="title">5. The Moral Ideal.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="center">A. <i>A Criticism of Ideals.</i></p>



<p class="parnum">330.</p>

<p>It were the thing to begin this criticism in suchwise as to do away
with the word "<i>Ideal</i>": a criticism of <i>desiderata.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">331.</p>

<p>Only the fewest amongst us are aware of what is involved, from the
standpoint of <i>desirability,</i> in every "thus should it be, but it
is not," or even "thus it ought to have been": such expressions of
opinion involve a condemnation of the whole course of events. For
there is nothing quite isolated in the world: the smallest thing bears
the largest on its back; on thy small injustice the whole nature of
the future depends; the whole is condemned by every criticism which
is directed at the smallest part of it. Now granting that the moral
norm&mdash;even as Kant understood it&mdash;is never completely fulfilled, and
remains like a sort of Beyond hanging over reality without ever falling
down to it; then morality would contain in itself a judgment concerning
the whole, which would still, however, allow of the question: <i>whence
does it get the right thereto?</i> How does the part come to acquire this
judicial position relative to the whole? And if, as some have declared,
this moral condemnation of, and dissatisfaction with, reality, is
an ineradicable instinct, is it not possible that this instinct may
perhaps belong to the ineradicable stupidities and immodesties of our
species?&mdash;But in saying this, we are doing precisely what we deprecate;
the point of view of desirability and of unauthorised fault-finding
is part and parcel of the whole character of worldly phenomena just
as every injustice and imperfection is&mdash;it is our very notion of
"perfection" which is never gratified. Every instinct which desires
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>be indulged gives expression to its dissatisfaction with the
present state of things: how? Is the whole perhaps made up of a host
of dissatisfied parts, which all have desiderata in their heads? Is
the "course of things" perhaps "the road hence? the road leading away
from reality "&mdash;that is to say, eternal dissatisfaction in itself? Is
the conception of desiderata perhaps the essential motive-power of all
things? Is it&mdash;<i>deus</i>?</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>It seems to me of the utmost importance that we should rid ourselves
of the notion of <i>the</i> whole, of an entity, and of any kind of power
or form of the unconditioned. For we shall never be able to resist the
temptation of regarding it as the supreme being, and of christening
it "God." The "All" must be subdivided; we must unlearn our respect
for it, and reappropriate that which we have lent the unknown and an
imaginary entity, for the purposes of our neighbour and ourselves.
Whereas, for instance, Kant said: "Two things remain for ever worthy
of honour" (at the close of his <i>Practical Reason</i>)&mdash;to-day we should
prefer to say: "Digestion is more worthy of honour." The concept,
"the All," will always give rise to the old problems, "How is evil
possible?" etc. Therefore, <i>there is no "All",</i> there <i>is no</i> great
<i>sensorium</i> or <i>inventarium</i> or power-magazine.</p>


<p class="parnum">332.</p>

<p>A man as he <i>ought</i> to be: this sounds to me in just as bad taste as:
"A tree as it ought to be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">333.</p>

<p>Ethics: or the "philosophy of desirability."&mdash;"Things <i>ought</i> to be
otherwise," "things <i>ought</i> to become different": dissatisfaction
would thus seem the heart of ethics.</p>

<p>One could find a way out of it, first, by selecting only those states
in which one is free from emotion; secondly, by grasping the insolence
and stupidity of the attitude of mind: for to desire that something
should be otherwise than it is, means to desire that <i>everything</i>
should be different&mdash;it involves a damaging criticism of the whole.
<i>But life itself consists in such desiring!</i></p>

<p>To ascertain <i>what exists, how it exists</i> seems an ever so much higher
and more serious matter than every "thus should it be," because the
latter, as a piece of human criticism and arrogance, appears to be
condemned as ludicrous from the start. It expresses a need which would
fain have the organisation of the world correspond with our human
well-being, and which directs the will as much as possible towards the
accomplishment of that relationship.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this desire, "thus it ought to be," has only called
forth that other desire, "<i>what exists?</i>" The desire of knowing what
exists, is already a consequence of the question, "how? is it possible?
Why precisely so?" Our wonder at the disagreement between our desires
and the course of the world has led to our learning to know the
course of the world. Perhaps the matter stands differently: maybe the
expression, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>"thus it ought to be," is merely the utterance of our
desire to overcome the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<p class="parnum">334.</p>

<p>To-day when every attempt at determining how man should be&mdash;is
received with some irony, when we adhere to the notion that in spite
of all one only <i>becomes</i> what one <i>is</i>(in spite of all&mdash;that is to
say, education, instruction, environment, accident, and disaster),
in the matter of morality we have learnt, in a very peculiar way,
how to <i>reverse</i> the relation of cause and effect. Nothing perhaps
distinguishes us more than this from the ancient believers in morality.
We no longer say, for instance, "Vice is the cause of a man's
physical ruin," and we no longer say, "A man prospers with virtue
because it brings a long life and happiness." Our minds to-day are
much more inclined to the belief that vice and virtue are not causes
but only <i>effects.</i> A man becomes a respectable member of society
because he <i>was</i> a respectable man from the start&mdash;that is to say,
because he was born in possession of good instincts and prosperous
propensities.... Should a man enter the world poor, and the son of
parents who are neither economical nor thrifty, he is insusceptible
of being improved&mdash;that is to say, he is only fit for the prison or
the madhouse.... To-day we are no longer able to separate moral from
physical degeneration: the former is merely a complicated symptom of
the latter; a man is necessarily bad just as he is necessarily ill....
Bad: this word here stands <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>for a certain <i>lack of capacity</i> which is
related physiologically with the degenerating type&mdash;for instance, a
weak will, an uncertain and many-sided personality, the inability to
resist reacting to a stimulus and to control one's self, and a certain
constraint resulting from every suggestion proceeding from another's
will. Vice is not a cause; it is an <i>effect.</i> ... Vice is a somewhat
arbitrary-epitome of certain effects resulting from physiological
degeneracy. A general proposition such as that which Christianity
teaches, namely, "Man is evil," would be justified provided one were
justified in regarding a given type of degenerate man as normal. But
this may be an exaggeration. Of course, wherever Christianity prospers
and prevails, the proposition holds good: for then the existence of an
unhealthy soil&mdash;of a degenerate territory&mdash;is demonstrated.</p>


<p class="parnum">335.</p>

<p>It is difficult to have sufficient respect for man, when one sees how
he understands the art of fighting his way, of enduring, of turning
circumstances to his own advantage, and of overthrowing opponents;
but when he is seen in the light of his <i>desires,</i> he is the most
absurd of all animals. It is just as if he required a playground
for his cowardice, his laziness, his feebleness, his sweetness, his
submissiveness, where he recovers from his strong virile virtues. Just
look at man's "<i>desiderata</i>" and his "ideals." Man, when he <i>desires,
</i> tries to recover from that which is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>eternally valuable in him, from
his deeds; and then he rushes into nonentity, absurdity, valuelessness,
childishness. The intellectual indigence and lack of inventive power of
this resourceful and inventive animal is simply terrible. The "ideal"
is at the same time the penalty man pays for the enormous expenditure
which he has to defray in all real and pressing duties.&mdash;Should reality
cease to prevail, there follow dreams, fatigue, weakness: an "ideal"
might even be regarded as a form of dream, fatigue, or weakness. The
strongest and the most impotent men become alike when this condition
overtakes them: they <i>deify</i> the cessation of work, of war, of
passions, of suspense, of contrasts, of "reality "&mdash;in short, of the
struggle for knowledge and of the <i>trouble</i> of acquiring it.</p>

<p>"Innocence" to them is idealised stultification; "blessedness" is
idealised idleness; "love," the ideal state of the gregarious animal
that will no longer have an enemy. And thus everything that lowers and
belittles man is elevated to an <i>ideal</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">336.</p>

<p>A desire <i>magnifies</i> the thing desired; and by not being realised it
grows&mdash;the <i>greatest ideas</i> are those which have been created by the
strongest and longest desiring. Things grow <i>ever more valuable</i> in our
estimation, the more our desire for them increases: if "moral values"
have become the highest values, it simply shows that the moral ideal
is the one which has been <i>realised least</i> (and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>thus it <i>represented
the Beyond to all suffering,</i> as a road to <i>blessedness</i>). Man,
with ever-increasing ardour, has only been embracing <i>clouds</i>: and
ultimately called his desperation and impotence "God."</p>


<p class="parnum">337.</p>

<p>Think of the <i>naïveté</i> of all ultimate "desiderata"&mdash;when the
"wherefore" of man remains unknown.</p>


<p class="parnum">338.</p>

<p>What is the counterfeit coinage of morality? First of all we should
know what "good and evil" mean. That is as good as wishing to know why
man is here, and what his goal or his destiny is. And that means that
one would fain know that man actually <i>has</i> a goal or a destiny.</p>


<p class="parnum">339.</p>

<p>The very obscure and arbitrary notion that humanity has a general
duty to perform, and that, as a whole, it is striving towards a
goal, is still in its infancy. Perhaps we shall once more be rid
of it before it becomes a "fixed idea." ... But humanity does not
constitute a whole: it is an indissoluble multiplicity of ascending
and descending organisms&mdash;it knows no such thing as a state of youth
followed by <i>maturity</i> and then age. But its strata lie confused and
superimposed&mdash;and in a few thousand years <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>there may be even younger
types of men than we can point out to-day. Decadence, on the other
hand, belongs to all periods of human history: everywhere there is
refuse and decaying matter, such things are in themselves vital
processes; for withering and decaying elements must be eliminated.</p>

<p>Under the empire of Christian prejudice <i>this question was never put
at all</i>: the purpose of life seemed to lie in the salvation of the
individual soul; the question whether humanity might last for a long or
a short time was not considered. The best Christians longed for the end
to come as soon as possible;&mdash;concerning the needs of the individual,
<i>there seemed to be no doubt whatsoever.</i> ... The duty of every
individual for the present was identical with what it would be in any
sort of future for the man of the future: the value, the purpose, the
limit of values was for ever fixed, unconditioned, eternal, one with
God.... What deviated from this eternal type was impious, diabolic,
criminal.</p>

<p>The centre of gravity of all values for each soul lay in that soul
itself: salvation or damnation! The salvation of the <i>immortal</i> soul!
The most extreme form of <i>personalisation....</i> For each soul there
was only one kind of perfection; only one ideal, only one road to
salvation.... The most extreme form of the principle of <i>equal rights,</i>
associated with an optical magnification of individual importance to
the point of megalomania <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>... Nothing but insanely important souls,
revolving round their own axes with unspeakable terror....</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Nobody believes in these assumed airs of importance any longer
to-day: and we have sifted our wisdom through the sieve of contempt.
Nevertheless the <i>optical habit</i> survives, which would fain measure the
value of man by his proximity to a certain <i>ideal maw.</i> at bottom the
personalisation view is upheld as firmly as that of the <i>equality of
rights as regards the ideal.</i> In short: people <i>seem to think that they
know</i> what <i>the ultimate desideratum</i> is in regard to the ideal man....</p>

<p>But this belief is merely the result of the exceedingly <i>detrimental
influence</i> of the Christian ideal, as anybody can discover for himself
every time he carefully examines the "ideal type." In the first place,
it is believed that the approach to a given "type" is desirable;
<i>secondly,</i> that this particular type is known; <i>thirdly,</i> that every
deviation from this type is a retrograde movement, a stemming of the
spirit of progress, a loss of power and might in man.... To dream of a
state of affairs in which this <i>perfect</i> man will be in the majority:
our friends the Socialists and even Messrs. the Utilitarians have not
reached a higher level than this. In this way an <i>aim</i> seems to have
crept into the <i>evolution</i> of man: at any rate the belief in a certain
<i>progress towards an ideal</i> is the only shape in which an <i>aim</i> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
conceived in the history of mankind to-day. In short: the coming of the
"<i>Kingdom of God</i>" has been placed in the future, and has been given an
earthly, a human meaning&mdash;but on the whole the faith in the <i>old</i> ideal
is still maintained....</p>


<p class="parnum">340.</p>

<p><i>The more concealed forms of the cult of Christian, moral ideals.</i>&mdash;The
<i>insipid and cowardly notion "Nature"</i> invented by Nature-enthusiasts
(without any knowledge whatsoever of the terrible, the implacable,
and the cynical element in even "the most beautiful" aspects), is
only a sort of attempt at <i>reading</i> the moral and Christian notion of
"humanity" into Nature;&mdash;Rousseau's concept of Nature, for instance,
which took for granted that "Nature" meant freedom, goodness,
innocence, equity, justice, and <i>Idylls,</i> was nothing more at bottom
than the cult of Christian morality. We should collect passages from
the poets in order to see <i>what</i> they admired, in lofty mountains, for
instance. What Goethe had to do with them&mdash;why he admired Spinoza.
Absolute <i>ignorance</i> concerning the reasons of this <i>cult....</i></p>

<p>The <i>insipid and cowardly concept "Man"</i> à la Comte and Stuart
Mill, is at times the subject of a cult.... This is only the
Christian moral ideal again under another name.... Refer also to the
freethinkers&mdash;Guyau for example.</p>

<p>The <i>insipid and cowardly concept "Art"</i> which is held to mean sympathy
with all suffering and with everything botched and bungled (the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
thing happens to <i>history,</i> cf. Thierry): again it is the cult of the
Christian moral ideal.</p>

<p>And now, as to the whole <i>socialistic ideal</i>: it is nothing but a
blockheaded misunderstanding of the Christian moral ideal.</p>


<p class="parnum">341.</p>

<p><i>The origin of the ideal.</i> The examination of the soil out of which it
grows.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Starting out from those "æsthetic" mental states during which the
world seems rounder, fuller, and <i>more perfect</i>: we have the pagan
ideal with its dominating spirit of self-affirmation (<i>people give of
their abundance</i>). The highest type: the <i>classical</i> ideal&mdash;regarded
as an expression of the successful nature of <i>all</i> the more important
instincts. In this classical ideal we find <i>the grand style</i> as the
highest style. An expression of the "will to power" itself. The
instinct which is most feared <i>dares to acknowledge itself.</i></p>

<p><i>B.</i> Starting out from the mental states in which the world seemed
emptier, paler, and thinner, when "spiritualisation" and the absence
of sensuality assume the rank of perfection, and when all that is
brutal, animal, direct, and proximate is avoided (<i>people calculate
and select</i>): the "sage," "the angel"; priestliness = virginity =
ignorance, are the physiological ideals of such idealists: the <i>anæmic</i>
ideal. Under certain circumstances this anæmic ideal may be the ideal
of such natures as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span><i>represent</i> paganism (thus Goethe sees his "saint"
in Spinoza).</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Starting out from those mental states in which the world seemed
more absurd, more evil, poorer, and more deceptive, an ideal cannot
even be imagined or desired in it (<i>people deny and annihilate</i>);
the projection of the ideal into the sphere of the anti-natural,
anti-actual, anti-logical; the state of him who judges thus (the
"impoverishment" of the world as a result of suffering: <i>people take,
they no longer bestow</i>): the <i>anti-natural ideal.</i></p>

<p>(The <i>Christian ideal</i> is a <i>transitional form</i> between the second
and the third, now inclining more towards the former type, and anon
inclining towards the latter.)</p>

<p><i>The three ideals: A.</i> Either a <i>strengthening</i> of Life (<i>paganism,</i>)
or <i>B.</i> an <i>impoverishment</i> of Life (<i>anæmia</i>), or <i>C.</i> a <i>denial</i> of
Life (<i>anti-naturalism</i>). The state of beatitude in <i>A.</i> is the feeling
of extreme abundance; in <i>B.</i> it is reached by the most fastidious
selectiveness; in <i>C.</i> it is the contempt and the destruction of Life.</p>


<p class="parnum">342.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The <i>consistent</i> type understands that even evil must not be
hated, must not be resisted, and that it is not allowable to make war
against one's self; that it does not suffice merely to accept the pain
which such behaviour brings in its train; that one lives entirely in
positive feelings; that one takes the side of one's opponents in word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and deed; that by means of a superfœtation of peaceful, kindly,
conciliatory, helpful, and loving states, one impoverishes the soil of
the other states, ... that one is in need of unremitting <i>practice.</i>
What is achieved thereby?&mdash;The Buddhistic type, or the <i>perfect</i> cow.</p>

<p>This point of view is possible only where no moral fanaticism
prevails&mdash;that is to say, when evil is not hated on its own account,
but because it opens the road to conditions which are painful (unrest,
work, care, complications, dependence).</p>

<p>This is the Buddhistic point of view: there is no hatred of sin, the
concept "sin," in fact, is entirely lacking.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> The <i>inconsistent</i> type. War is waged against evil&mdash;there is a
belief that war waged <i>for Goodness' sake</i> does not involve the same
moral results or affect character in the same way as war generally
does (and owing to which tendencies it is detested as <i>evil).</i> As a
matter of fact, a war of this sort carried on against evil is much
more profoundly pernicious than any sort of personal hostility; and
generally, it is "the person" which reassumes, at least in fancy, the
position of opponent (the devil, evil spirits, etc.). The attitude of
hostile observation and spying in regard to everything which may be
bad in us, or hail from a bad source, culminates in a most tormented
and most anxious state of mind: thus "miracles," rewards, ecstasy, and
transcendental solutions of the earth-riddle now became <i>desirable</i>.
... The Christian type: or the <i>perfect bigot</i>.</p>

<p>An ideal which is striving to prevail or to assert itself endeavours
to further its purpose <i>(a)</i> by laying claim to a <i>spurious</i> origin;
<i>(b)</i> by assuming a relationship between itself and the powerful ideals
already existing; <i>(c)</i> by means of the thrill produced by mystery,
as though an unquestionable power were manifesting itself; <i>(d)</i> by
the slander of its opponents' ideals; <i>(e)</i> by a lying teaching of
the advantages which follow in its wake, for instance: happiness,
spiritual peace, general peace, or even the assistance of a mighty
God, etc.&mdash;Contributions to the psychology of the idealists: Carlyle,
Schiller, Michelet.</p>

<p>Supposing all the means of defence and protection, by means of which an
ideal survives, are discovered, is it thereby <i>refuted</i>? It has merely
availed itself of the means of which everything lives and grows&mdash;they
are all "immoral."</p>

<p>My view: all the forces and instincts which are the source of life
are lying beneath the <i>ban of morality</i>: morality is the life-denying
instinct. Morality must be annihilated if life is to be emancipated.</p>

<p>To <i>avoid</i> knowing himself is the prudence of the idealist. The

concerning these reasons also.</p>

<p><i>The tendency of moral evolution.</i>&mdash;Every one's desire is that there
should be no other teaching and valuation of things than those by means
of which he himself succeeds. Thus the <i>fundamental tendency</i> of the
<i>weak</i> and <i>mediocre</i> of all times, has been to <i>enfeeble the strong
and to reduce them to the level of the weak: their chief weapon in this
process</i> was the <i>moral principle.</i> The attitude of the strong towards
the weak is branded as evil; the highest states of the strong become
bad bywords.</p>

<p>The struggle of the many against the strong, of the ordinary against
the extraordinary, of the weak against the strong: meets with one
of its finest interruptions in the fact that the rare, the refined,
the more exacting, present themselves as the weak, and repudiate the
coarser weapons of power.</p>

<p>(1) The so-called pure instinct for knowledge of all philosophers
is dictated to them by their moral "truths," and is only seemingly
independent.</p>

<p>(2) The "Moral Truths," "thus shall things be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>done," are mere states
of consciousness of an instinct which has grown tired, "thus and thus
are things done by us." The "ideal" is supposed to re-establish and
strengthen an instinct; it flatters man to feel he can obey when he is
only an automaton.</p>


<p class="parnum">347.</p>

<p><i>Morality as a means of seduction.</i>&mdash;"Nature is good; for a wise
and good God is its cause. Who, therefore, is responsible for the
'corruption of man'? Tyrants and seducers and the ruling classes are
responsible&mdash;they must be wiped out": this is Rousseau's logic (compare
with <i>Pascals</i> logic, which concludes by an appeal to original sin).</p>

<p>Refer also to <i>Luther's</i> logic, which is similar. In both cases a
pretext is sought for the introduction of an insatiable lust of revenge
as a <i>moral and religious</i> duty. The hatred directed against the ruling
classes tries to <i>sanctify</i> itself ... (the "sinfulness of Israel" is
the basis of the priest's powerful position).</p>

<p>Compare this with <i>Pauls</i> logic, which is similar. It is always under
the cover of God's business that these reactions appear, under the
cover of what is right, or of humanity, etc. In the case of <i>Christ</i>
the rejoicings of the people appear as the cause of His crucifixion.
It was an anti-priestly movement from the beginning. Even in the
anti-Semitic movement we find the same trick: the opponent is overcome
with moral condemnations, and those who attack him pose as <i>retributive
Justice.</i></p>

<p><i>The incidents of the fight</i>: the fighter tries to transform his
opponent into the <i>exact opposite</i> of himself&mdash;imaginatively, of
course. He tries to believe in himself to such an extent that he may
have the courage necessary for the "good Cause" (as if he were the
<i>good Cause</i>); as if reason, taste, and virtue were being assailed
by his opponents.... The belief of which he is most in need, as the
strongest means of defence and attack, <i>is the belief in himself,</i>
which, however, knows how to misinterpret itself as a belief in
1God. He never pictures the advantages and the uses of victory, but
only understands victory for the sake of victory&mdash;for God's sake.
Every small community (or individual), finding itself involved in
a struggle, strives to convince itself of this: "<i>Good taste, good
judgment, and virtue are ours.</i>" War urges people to this <i>exaggerated
self-esteem</i>....</p>


<p class="parnum">349.</p>

<p>Whatever kind of <i>eccentric ideal</i> one may have (whether as
a "Christian," a "free-spirit," an "immoralist," or a German
Imperialist), one should try to avoid insisting upon its being <i>the</i>
ideal; for, by so doing, it is deprived of all its privileged nature.
One should have an ideal as a distinction; one should not propagate it,
and thus level one's self down to the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>How is it, that in spite of this obvious fact, the majority of
idealists indulge in propaganda for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>their ideal, just as if they had
no right to it unless the <i>majority</i> acquiesce therein?&mdash;For instance,
all those plucky and insignificant girls behave in this way, who claim
the right to study Latin and mathematics. What is it urges them to do
this? I fear it is the instinct of the herd, and the terror of the
herd: they fight for the "emancipation of woman," because they are best
able to achieve their own private little distinction by fighting for it
under the cover of a <i>charitable movement,</i> under the banner bearing
the device "For others."</p>

<p>The <i>cleverness</i> of idealists consists in their persistently posing
as the missionaries and "representatives" of an ideal: they thus
"beautify" themselves in the eyes of those who still believe in
disinterestedness and heroism. Whereas real heroism consists, <i>not</i>
in fighting under the banner of self-sacrifice, submission, and
disinterestedness, but in <i>not fighting at all</i>.... "I am thus; I will
be thus&mdash;and you can go to the devil!"</p>

<p class="parnum">351.</p>

<p>The "<i>good man</i>" Or, hemiplegia of virtue.&mdash;In the opinion of every
strong and natural man, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>love and hate, gratitude and revenge, goodness
and anger, affirmative and negative action, belong to each other. A
man is good on condition that he knows how to be evil; a man is evil,
because otherwise he would not know how to be good. Whence comes
the morbidness and ideological unnaturalness which repudiates these
compounds&mdash;which teaches a sort of one-sided efficiency as the highest
of all things? Whence this hemiplegia of virtue, the invention of the
good man? The object seems to be to make man amputate those instincts
which enable him to be an enemy, to be harmful, to be angry, and to
insist upon revenge.... This unnaturalness, then, corresponds to that
dualistic concept of a wholly good and of a wholly bad creature (God,
Spirit, Man); in the first are found all the positive, in the second
all the negative forces, intentions, and states. This method of valuing
thus believes itself to be "idealistic"; it never doubts that in its
concept of the "good man," it has found the highest desideratum. When
aspiring to its zenith it fancies a state in which all evil is wiped
out, and in which only good creatures have actually remained over.
It does not therefore regard the mutual dependence of the opposites
good and evil as proved. On the contrary, the latter ought to vanish,
and the former should remain. The first has a right to exist, the
second ought not <i>to be with us at all....</i> What, as a matter of fact,
is the reason of this desire? In all ages, and particularly in the
Christian age, much labour has been spent in trying to reduce men
to this one-sided activity: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>and even to-day, among those who have
been deformed and weakened by the Church, people are not lacking who
desire precisely the same thing with their "humanisation" generally,
or with their "Will of God," or with their "Salvation of the Soul."
The principal injunction behind all these things is, that man should
no longer do anything evil, that he should under no circumstances be
harmful or <i>desire</i> harm. The way to arrive at this state of affairs is
to amputate all hostile tendencies, to suppress all the instincts of
resentment, and to establish "spiritual peace" as a chronic disease.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind, in which a certain type of man is bred,
starts out with this absurd hypothesis: good and evil are postulated
as realities which are in a state of mutual contradiction (not as
complementary values, which they are), people are advised to take the
side of the good, and it is insisted upon that a good man resists
and forswears evil until every trace of it is uprooted&mdash;<i>but with
this valuation Life is actually denied,</i> for in all its instincts
Life has both yea and nay. But far from understanding these facts,
this valuation dreams rather of returning to the wholeness, oneness,
and strengthfulness of Life: it actually believes that a state of
blessedness will be reached when the inner anarchy and state of unrest
which result from these opposed impulses is brought to an end.&mdash;It is
possible that no more dangerous ideology, no greater mischief <i>in the
science of psychology,</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>has ever yet existed, as this will to good: the
most repugnant type of man has been reared, the man who is <i>not free,</i>
the bigot; it was taught that only in the form of a bigot could one
tread the path which leads to God, and that only a bigot's life could
be a godly life.</p>

<p>And even here, Life is still in the right&mdash;Life that knows not how to
separate Yea from Nay: what is the good of declaring with all one's
might that war is an evil, that one must harm no one, that one must
not act negatively? One is still waging a war even in this, it is
impossible to do otherwise! The good man who has renounced all evil,
and who is afflicted according to his desire with the hemiplegia of
virtue, does not therefore cease from waging war, or from making
enemies, or from saying "nay" and doing "nay." The Christian, for
instance, hates "sin"!&mdash;and what on earth is there which he does
not call "sin"! It is precisely because of his belief in a moral
antagonism between good and evil, that the world for him has grown
so full of hatefulness and things that must be combated eternally.
The "good man" sees himself surrounded by evil, and, thanks to the
continual onslaughts of the latter, his eye grows more keen, and in
the end discovers traces of evil in every one of his acts. And thus he
ultimately arrives at the conclusion, which to him is quite logical,
that Nature is evil, that man is corrupted, and that being good is an
act of grace (that is to say, it is impossible to man when he stands
alone). In short: <i>he denies Life,</i> he sees how "good," as the highest
value, <i>condemns</i> Life.... And thus his ideology concerning good and
evil <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ought to strike him as refuted. But one cannot refute a disease.
Therefore he is obliged to conceive <i>another</i> life!...</p>


<p class="parnum">352.</p>

<p>Power, whether in the hands of a god or of a man, is always understood
to consist in the ability to <i>harm</i> as well as to <i>help.</i> This is the
case with the Arabs and with the Hebrews, in fact with all strong and
well-constituted races.</p>

<p>The dualistic separation of the two powers is fatal.... In this way
morality becomes the poisoner of life.</p>


<p class="parnum">353.</p>

<p><i>A criticism of the good man.</i>&mdash;Honesty, dignity, dutifulness, justice,
humanity, loyalty, uprightness, clean conscience&mdash;is it really supposed
that, by means of these fine-sounding words, the qualities they stand
for are approved and affirmed for their own sake? Or is it this, that
qualities and states indifferent in themselves have merely been looked
at in a light which lends them some value? Does the worth of these
qualities lie in themselves, or in the use and advantages to which they
lead (or to which they seem to lead, to which they are expected to
lead)?</p>

<p>I naturally do not wish to imply that there is any opposition between
the <i>ego</i> and the <i>alter</i> in the judgment: the question is, whether
it is the <i>results</i> of these qualities, either in regard to him who
possesses them or in regard to environment, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>society, "humanity," which
lend them their value; or whether they have a value in themselves....
In other words: is it <i>utility</i> which bids men condemn, combat, and
deny the opposite qualities (duplicity, falseness, perversity, lack
of self-confidence, inhumanity)? Is the essence of such qualities
condemned, or only their consequences? In other words: were it
<i>desirable</i> that there should exist no men at all possessed of such
qualities? <i>In any case, this is believed</i>.... But here lies the error,
the shortsightedness, the monocularity of <i>narrow egoism.</i></p>

<p>Expressed otherwise: would it be desirable to create circumstances in
which the whole advantage would be on the side of the just&mdash;so that
all those with opposite natures and instincts would be discouraged and
would slowly become extinct?</p>

<p>At bottom, this is a question of taste and of <i>æsthetics</i>: should we
desire the most honourable types of men&mdash;that is to say, the greatest
bores&mdash;alone to subsist? the rectangular, the virtuous, the upright,
the good-natured, the straightforward, and the "blockheads"?</p>

<p>If one can imagine the total suppression of the huge number
constituting the "others," even the just man himself ceases from having
a right to exist,&mdash;he is, in fact, no longer necessary,&mdash;and in this
way it is seen that coarse utility alone could have elevated such an
<i>insufferable</i> virtue to a place of honour.</p>

<p>Desirability may lie precisely on the other side. It might be better
to create conditions in which the "just man" would be reduced to
the humble <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>position of a "useful instrument"&mdash;an "ideal gregarious
animal," or at best a herdsman: in short, conditions in which he would
no longer stand in the highest sphere, which requires <i>other qualities</i>.</p>

<p><i>The "good man" as a tyrant&mdash;</i>Mankind has always repeated the same
error: it has always transformed a mere vital measure into the
<i>measure</i> and standard of life;&mdash;instead of seeking the standard in
the highest ascent of life, in the problem of growth and exhaustion,
it takes the <i>preservative measures</i> of a very definite kind of life,
and uses them to exclude all other kinds of life, and even to criticise
Life itself and to select from among its forms. That is to say, man
ultimately forgets that measures are a means to an end, and gets to
like them for themselves: they take the place of a goal in his mind,
and even become the standard of goals to him&mdash;that is to say, <i>a given
species of man</i> regards his means of existence as the only legitimate
means, as the means which ought to be imposed upon all, as "truth,"
"goodness," "perfection": the given species, in fact, begins to
<i>tyrannise.</i> ... It is a <i>form of faith,</i> of instinct, when a certain
species of man does not perceive that his kind has been conditioned,
when he does not understand his relation to other species. At any rate,
any species of men (a people or a race) seems to be doomed as soon as
it becomes tolerant, grants equal rights, and no longer desires to be
master.</p>

<p>The behaviour of a higher man is the result of a very complex set of
motives: any word such as "pity" <i>betrays</i> nothing of this complexity.
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>most important factor is the feeling, "who am I? who is the other
relative to me?"&mdash;Thus the valuing spirit is continually active.</p>


<p class="parnum">366.</p>

<p>To think that the history of all moral phenomena may be simplified, as
Schopenhauer thought,&mdash;that is to say, that <i>pity</i> is to be found at
the root of every moral impulse that has ever existed hitherto,&mdash;is
to be guilty of a degree of nonsense and ingenuousness worthy only
of a thinker who is devoid of all historical instincts and who has
miraculously succeeded in evading the strong schooling in history which
the Germans, from Herder to Hegel, have undergone.</p>

<p><i>My "pity."</i>&mdash;This is a feeling for which I can find no adequate
term: I feel it when I am in the presence of any waste of precious
capabilities, as, for instance, when I contemplate Luther: what power
and what tasteless problems fit for back-woodsmen! (At a time when the
brave and light-hearted scepticism of a Montaigne was already possible
in France!) Or when I see some one standing below where he might have
stood, thanks to the development of a set of perfectly senseless
accidents. Or even when, with the thought of man's destiny in my mind,
I contemplate with horror and contempt the whole system of modern
European politics, which is creating the circumstances <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>and weaving
the fabric of the <i>whole</i> future of mankind. Yes, to what could not
"mankind" attain, if&mdash;&mdash;! This is my "pity"; despite the fact that no
sufferer yet exists with whom I sympathise in this way.</p>


<p class="parnum">368.</p>

<p>Pity is a waste of feeling, a moral parasite which is injurious to
the health, "it cannot possibly be our duty to increase the evil in
the world." If one does good merely out of pity, it is one's self and
not one's neighbour that one is succouring. Pity does not depend upon

the end it is stemmed, otherwise it would be the end of everything
owing to the waste it would bring about. Thus: that which is
"unegoistic," self-sacrificing, and imprudent is nothing in particular
&mdash;it is common to all the instincts; they do not consider the welfare
of the whole <i>ego</i> (<i>because they simply do not think!</i>), they act
counter to our interests, against the <i>ego</i>: and often <i>for</i> the

physiological value of him who possesses it. Each individual represents
the whole course of Evolution, and he is not, as morals teach,
something that begins at his birth. If he represent the <i>ascent</i> of the
line of mankind, his value is, in fact, very great; and the concern
about his maintenance and the promoting of his growth may even be
extreme. (It is the concern about the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>promise of the future in him
which gives the well-constituted individual such an extraordinary right
to egoism.) If he represent <i>descending</i> development, decay, chronic
sickening, he has little worth: and the greatest fairness would have
him take as little room, strength, and sunshine as possible from the
well-constituted. In this case society's duty is to <i>suppress egoism</i>
(for the latter may sometimes manifest itself in an absurd, morbid,
and seditious manner): whether it be a question of the decline and
pining away of single individuals or of whole classes of mankind. A
morality and a religion of "love," the <i>curbing</i> of the self-affirming
spirit, and a doctrine encouraging patience, resignation, helpfulness,
and co-operation in word and deed may be of the highest value within
the confines of such classes, even in the eyes of their rulers:
for it restrains the feelings of rivalry, of resentment, and of
envy,&mdash;feelings which are only too natural in the bungled and the
botched,&mdash;and it even deifies them under the ideal of humility, of
obedience, of slave-life, of being ruled, of poverty, of illness, and
of lowliness. This explains why the ruling classes (or races) and
individuals of all ages have always upheld the cult of unselfishness,
the gospel of the lowly and of "God on the Cross."</p>

<p>The preponderance of an altruistic way of valuing is the result of
a consciousness of the fact that one is botched and bungled. Upon
examination, this point of view turns out to be: "I am not worth
much," simply a psychological valuation; more plainly still: it is
the feeling of impotence, of the lack of the great self-asserting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
impulses of power (in muscles, nerves, and ganglia). This valuation
gets translated, according to the particular culture of these classes,
into a moral or religious principle (the pre-eminence of religious or
moral precepts is always a sign of low culture): it tries to justify
itself in spheres whence, as far as it is concerned, the notion "value"
hails. The interpretation by means of which the Christian sinner
tries to understand himself, is an attempt at justifying his lack of
power and of self-confidence: he prefers to feel himself a sinner
rather than feel bad for nothing: it is in itself a symptom of decay
when interpretations of this sort are used at all. In some cases the
bungled and the botched do not look for the reason of their unfortunate
condition in their own guilt (as the Christian does), but in society:
when, however, the Socialist, the Anarchist, and the Nihilist are
conscious that their existence is something for which some one must
be <i>guilty,</i> they are very closely related to the Christian, who also
believes that he can more easily endure his ill ease and his wretched
constitution when he has found some one whom he can hold <i>responsible</i>
for it. The instinct of <i>revenge</i> and <i>resentment</i> appears in both
cases here as a means of enduring life, as a self-preservative measure,
as is also the favour shown to <i>altruistic</i> theory and practice. The
<i>hatred of egoism,</i> whether it be one's own (as in the case of the
Christian), or another's (as in the case of the Socialists), thus
appears as a valuation reached under the predominance of revenge; and
also as an act of prudence on the part of the preservative instinct
of the suffering, in the form <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>of an increase in their feelings of
co-operation and unity.... At bottom, as I have already suggested,
the discharge of resentment which takes place in the act of judging,
rejecting, and punishing egoism (one's own or that of others) is
still a self-preservative measure on the part of the bungled and the
botched. In short: the cult of altruism is merely a particular form of
egoism, which regularly appears under certain definite physiological
circumstances.</p>

<p>When the Socialist, with righteous indignation, cries for "justice,"
"rights," "equal rights," it only shows that he is oppressed by his
inadequate culture, and is unable to understand why he suffers: he
also finds pleasure in crying;&mdash;if he were more at ease he would take
jolly good care not to cry in that way: in that case he would seek his
pleasure elsewhere. The same holds good of the Christian: he curses,
condemns, and slanders the "world"&mdash;and does not even except himself.
But that is no reason for taking him seriously. In both cases we are
in the presence of invalids who feel better for crying, and who find
relief in slander.</p>


<p class="parnum">374.</p>

<p>Every society has a tendency to reduce its opponents to
<i>caricatures,</i>&mdash;at least in its own imagination,&mdash;as also to
starve them. As an example of this sort of caricature we have our
"<i>criminal.</i>" In the midst of the Roman and aristocratic order of
values, the <i>Jew</i> was reduced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>to a caricature. Among artists, "Mrs.
Grundy and the bourgeois" become caricatures; while among pious
people it is the heretics, and among aristocrats, the plebeian. Among
immoralists it is the moralist. Plato, for instance, in <i>my</i> books
becomes a caricature.</p>


<p class="parnum">375.</p>

<p>All the instincts and forces which morality praises, seem to me to
be essentially the same as those which it slanders and rejects: for
instance, justice as will to power, will to truth as a means in the
service of the will to power.</p>


<p class="parnum">376.</p>

<p>The <i>turning of</i> man's <i>nature inwards.</i> The process of turning a
nature inwards arises when, owing to the establishment of peace and
society, powerful instincts are prevented from venting themselves
outwardly, and strive to survive harmlessly inside in conjunction with
the imagination. The need of hostility, cruelty, revenge, and violence
is reverted, "it steps backwards"; in the thirst for knowledge there
lurks both the lust of gain and of conquest; in the artist, the powers
of dissimulation and falsehood find their scope; the instincts are thus
transformed into demons with whom a fight takes place, etc.</p>


<p class="parnum">377.</p>

<p><i>Falsity.</i>&mdash;Every <i>sovereign instinct</i> makes the others its
instruments, its retainers and its sycophants: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>it never allows itself
to be called by its more hateful name: and it brooks no terms of praise
in which it cannot <i>indirectly</i> find its share. Around every sovereign
instinct all praise and blame in general crystallises into a rigorous
form of ceremonial and etiquette. This is <i>one</i> of the causes of
falsity.</p>

<p><i>Every</i> instinct <i>which aspires to dominion,</i> but which finds itself
under a yoke, requisitions all the most beautiful names and the
<i>most generally accepted</i> values to strengthen it and to support its
self-esteem, and this explains why <i>as a rule</i> it dares to come forward
under the name of the "master" it is combating and from whom it would
be free (for instance, under the domination of Christian values, the
desires of the flesh and of power act in this way). This is the <i>other</i>
cause of falsity.</p>

<p>In both cases <i>complete ingenuousness</i> reigns: the falseness <i>never</i>
even occurs to the mind of those concerned. It is the sign of a
<i>broken</i> instinct when man sees the motive force and its "expression"
("the mask") as separate things&mdash;it is a sign of inner contradiction
and is much less formidable. Absolute <i>innocence</i> in bearing, word,
and passion, a "good conscience" in falseness, and the certainty
wherewith all the grandest and most pompous words and attitudes are
appropriated&mdash;all these things are necessary for victory.</p>

<p>In the <i>other case</i>: that is to say, when <i>extreme clearsightedness</i>
is present, the genius of the <i>actor</i> is needful as well as tremendous
discipline in self-control, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>if victory is to be achieved. That is why
priests are the cleverest and <i>most conscious</i> hypocrites; and then
come princes, in whom their position in life and their antecedents
account for a certain histrionic gift. Society men and diplomatists
come third, and women fourth.</p>

<p><i>The fundamental thought</i>: Falsity seems so deep, so many-sided, and
the <i>will</i> is directed so inexorably against perfect self-knowledge
and accurate self-classification, that one is <i>very probably right in
supposing that Truth</i> and <i>the will to truth</i> are perhaps something
quite different and only <i>disguises.</i> (The need of <i>faith</i> is the
greatest obstacle in the way of truthfulness.)</p>


<p class="parnum">378.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not tell a falsehood": people insist upon truthfulness. But
the acknowledgment of facts (the refusal to allow one's self to be lied
to) has always been greatest with liars: they actually recognised the
reality of this popular "truthfulness." There is too much or too little
being said continually: to insist upon people's <i>exposing themselves</i>
with every word they say, is a piece of naïveté.</p>

<p>People say what they think, they are "truthful"; but <i>only under
certain circumstances</i>: that is to say, provided they be <i>understood</i>
(<i>inter pares</i>), and understood with good will into the bargain (<i>once
more inter pares</i>). One conceals one's self in the presence of the
<i>unfamiliar</i>: and he who would attain to something, says what he would
fain have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>people think about him, but <i>not</i> what he thinks. ("The
powerful man is always a liar.")**</p>

<p>The great counterfeit coinage of Nihilism concealed beneath an artful

<p><i>(b)</i> The <i>most impersonal intellect</i> ("the philosopher") can know the
<i>truth</i>, "the true essence and nature of things."</p>

<p><i>(c)</i> Genius, <i>great men</i> are <i>great,</i> because they do not strive
to further their own interests: the <i>value</i> of man <i>increases</i> in
proportion as he effaces himself.</p>

<p><i>(d)</i> Art as the work of the "<i>pure free-willed subject</i>";
misunderstanding of "objectivity."</p>

<p><i>(e)</i> Happiness as the object of life: <i>virtue</i> as a means to an end.</p>

<p>The pessimistic condemnation of life by Schopenhauer is a <i>moral</i> one.
Transference of the gregarious standards into the realm of metaphysics.</p>

<p>The "individual" lacks sense, he must therefore have his origin in "the
thing in itself" (and the significance of his existence must be shown
to be "error"); parents are only an "accidental cause."&mdash;The mistake
on the part of science in considering the individual as the result of
all past life instead of the epitome of all past life, is now becoming
known.</p>

regarded as the result of high moral excellence.</p>

<p>2. Systematic falsification of <i>great men, great creators,</i> and <i>great
periods.</i> The desire is to make <i>faith</i> that which distinguishes great
men: whereas carelessness in this respect, scepticism, "immorality,"
the right to repudiate a belief, belongs to greatness (Cæsar, Frederick
the Great, Napoleon; but also Homer, Aristophanes, Leonardo, Goethe).
The principal fact&mdash;their "free will"&mdash;is always suppressed.</p>


<p class="parnum">381.</p>

<p>A great <i>lie</i> in history; as if the <i>corruption of the Church were the
cause</i> of the Reformation! This was only the pretext and self-deception
of the agitators&mdash;very strong needs were making themselves felt, the
brutality of which sorely required a spiritual dressing.</p>


<p class="parnum">382.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer declared high intellectuality to be the <i>emancipation</i>
from the will: he did not wish to recognise the freedom from moral
prejudices which is coincident with the emancipation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>of a great mind;
he refused to see what is the typical immorality of genius; he artfully
contrived to set up the only moral value he honoured&mdash;self-effacement,
as the one <i>condition</i> of highest intellectual activity: "objective"
contemplation. "Truth," even in art, only manifests itself after the
withdrawal of the <i>will</i>....</p>

<p>Through all moral idiosyncrasies I see a <i>fundamentally different
valuation.</i> Such absurd distinctions as "genius" and the world of will,
of morality and immorality, <i>I know nothing about at all.</i> The moral is
a lower kind of animal than the immoral, he is also weaker; indeed&mdash;he
is a type in regard to morality, but he is not a type of his own. He
is a copy; at the best, a good copy&mdash;the standard of his worth lies
<i>without</i> him. I value a man according to the <i>quantum of power and
fullness of his will</i>: not according to the enfeeblement and moribund
state thereof. I consider that a philosophy which <i>teaches</i> the denial
of will is both defamatory and slanderous.... I test the <i>power</i> of
a <i>will</i> according to the amount of resistance it can offer and the
amount of pain and torture it can endure and know how to turn to its
own advantage; I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with
the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one
day be more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.</p>

<p>The zenith of intellectuality, according to Schopenhauer, was to arrive
at the knowledge that all is to no purpose&mdash;in short, to recognise what
the good man already <i>does</i> instinctively.... <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>He denies that there can
be higher states of intellectuality&mdash;he regards his view as a <i>non plus
ultra..</i>.. Here intellectuality is placed much lower than goodness; its
highest value (as art, for instance) would be to lead up to, and to
advise the adoption of, morality, the absolute predominance of <i>moral
values.</i></p>

<p>Next to Schopenhauer I will now characterise <i>Kant</i>: there was nothing
Greek in Kant; he was quite anti-historical (cf. his attitude in
regard to the French Revolution) and a moral fanatic (see Goethe's
words concerning the radically evil element in human nature<a name="FNanchor_8_15" id="FNanchor_8_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_15" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>).
<i>Saintliness</i> also lurked somewhere in his soul.... I require a
criticism of the saintly type.</p>

<p>Hegel's value: "Passion."</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer's tea-grocer's philosophy: total absence of an ideal

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Fundamental instinct of all philosophers, historians, and
psychologists: everything of <i>value</i> in mankind, art, history, science,
religion, and technology must be shown to be <i>morally valuable</i> and
<i>morally conditioned,</i> in its aim, means, and result. Everything is
seen in the light of this highest value; for instance, Rousseau's
question concerning civilisation, "Will it make man grow better?"&mdash;a
funny question, for the reverse is <i>obvious,</i> and is a fact which
speaks <i>in favour</i> of civilisation.</p>

passage in a letter written by Goethe to Herder, on 7th June 1793,
from the camp at Marienborn, near Mainz, in which the following
words occur:&mdash;"<i>Dagegen hat aber auch Kant seinen philosophischen
Mantel, nachdem er ein langes Menschenleben gebraucht hat, ihn von
mancherlei sudelhaften Vorurteilen zu reinigen, freventlich mit dem
Schandfleck des radikalen Bösen beschlabbert, damit doch auch Christen
herbeigelockt werden den Saum zu küssen?&mdash;</i>("Kant, on the other hand,
after he had tried throughout his life to keep his philosophical cloak
unsoiled by foul prejudices, wantonly dirtied it in the end with the
disreputable stain of the 'radical evil' in human nature, in order that
Christians too might be lured into kissing its hem.") From this passage
it will be seen how Goethe had anticipated Nietzsche's view of Kant;
namely, that he was a Christian in disguise.</p></div>


<p class="parnum">383.</p>

<p><i>Religious morality.&mdash;</i>Passion, great desire; the passion for power,
love, revenge, and property: the moralists wish to uproot and
exterminate all these things, and "purify" the soul by driving them out
of it.</p>

<p>The argument is: the passions often lead to disaster&mdash;therefore, they
are evil and ought to be condemned. Man must wring himself free from
them, otherwise he cannot be a <i>good</i> man....</p>

<p>This is of the same nature as: "If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it
out." In this particular case when, with that "bucolic simplicity,"
the Founder of Christianity recommended a certain practice to His
disciples, in the event of sexual excitement, the result would not be
only the loss of a particular member, but the actual castration of the
whole of the man's character.... And the same applies to the moral
mania, which, instead of insisting upon the control of the passions,
sues for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>their extirpation. Its conclusion always is: only the
emasculated man is a good man.</p>

<p>Instead of making use of and of <i>economising</i> the great sources of
passion, those torrents of the soul which are often so dangerous,
overwhelming, and impetuous, morality&mdash;this most shortsighted and most
corrupted of mental attitudes&mdash;would fain make them <i>dry up.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">384.</p>

<p><i>Conquest over the passions?</i>&mdash;No, not if this is to mean their
enfeeblement and annihilation. <i>They must be enlisted in our service</i>:
and to this end it may be necessary to tyrannise them a good deal (not
as individuals, but as communities, races, etc.). At length we should
trust them enough to restore their freedom to them: they love us like
good servants, and willingly go wherever our best interests lie.</p>


<p class="parnum">385.</p>

<p><i>Intolerance on the part of morality</i> is a sign of man's <i>weakness</i>:
he is frightened of his own "immorality," he must <i>deny</i> his strongest
<i>instincts,</i> because he does not yet know how to use them. Thus the
most fruitful quarters of the globe remain uncultivated longest: the
power is lacking that might become master here....</p>


<p class="parnum">386.</p>

<p>There are some very simple peoples and men who believe that continuous
fine weather would be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>a desirable thing: they still believe to-day
in <i>rebus moralibus,</i> that the "good man" alone and nothing else than
the "good man" is to be desired, and that the ultimate end of man's
evolution will be that only the good man will remain on earth (and that
it is only to that end that all efforts should be directed). This is
in the highest degree an <i>uneconomical</i> thought; as we have already
suggested, it is the very acme of simplicity, and it is nothing more
than the expression of the <i>agreeableness</i> which the "good man" creates
(he gives rise to no fear, he permits of relaxation, he gives what one
is able to take).</p>

<p>With a more educated eye one learns to desire exactly the reverse&mdash;that
is to say, an ever greater <i>dominion of evil,</i> man's gradual
emancipation from the narrow and aggravating bonds of morality, the
growth of power around the greatest forces of Nature, and the ability
to enlist the passions in one's service.</p>


<p class="parnum">387.</p>

<p>The whole idea of the hierarchy of the <i>passions</i>: as if the only right
and normal thing were to be led by <i>reason</i>&mdash;whereas the passions are
abnormal, dangerous, half-animal, and moreover, in so far as their end
is concerned, nothing more than <i>desires for pleasure....</i></p>

<p>Passion is deprived of its dignity (1) as if it only manifested
itself in an unseemly way and were not necessary and always the
<i>motive force</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>(2) inasmuch as it is supposed to aim at no high
purpose&mdash;merely at pleasure....</p>

<p>The misinterpretation of passion and <i>reason,</i> as if the latter were
an independent entity, and not a state of relationship between all
the various passions and desires; and as though every passion did not
possess its quantum of reason....</p>


<p class="parnum">388.</p>

<p>How it was that, under the pressure of the dominion of an ascetic
and <i>self-effacing morality,</i> it was precisely the passions&mdash;love,
goodness, pity, even justice, generosity, and heroism, which were
necessarily misunderstood?</p>

<p>It is the <i>richness of a personality,</i> the fullness of it, its power
to flow over and to bestow, its instinctive feeling of ease, and its
affirmative attitude towards itself, that creates great love and great
sacrifices: these passions proceed from strong and godlike personalism
as surely as do the desire to be master, to obtrude, and the inner
certainty that one has a right to everything. The <i>opposite</i> views,
according to the most accepted notions, are indeed common views; and if
one does not stand firmly and bravely on one's legs, one has nothing to
give, and it is perfectly useless to stretch out one's hand either to
protect or to support others....</p>

<p>How was it possible to <i>transform</i> these instincts to such an extent
that man could feel that to be of value which is directed against
himself, so that he could sacrifice himself for another self! O the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
psychological baseness and falseness which hitherto has laid down the
law in the Church and in Church-infected philosophy!</p>

<p>If man is thoroughly sinful, then all he can do is to hate himself. As
a matter of fact, he ought not to regard even his fellows otherwise
than he does himself; the love of man requires a justification, and it
is found in the fact that <i>God commanded it.</i>&mdash;From this it follows
that all the natural instincts of man (to love, etc.) appear to him
to be, in themselves, prohibited; and that he re-acquires a right to
them only after having <i>denied</i> them as an obedient worshipper of God.
... Pascal, the admirable <i>logician</i> of Christianity, <i>went as far as
this</i>! let any one examine his relations to his sister. "Not to make
one's self loved," seemed Christian to him.</p>


<p class="parnum">389.</p>

<p>Let us consider how dearly a moral canon such as this ("an ideal")
makes us pay. (Its enemies are&mdash;well? The "egoists.")</p>

<p>The melancholy astuteness of self-abasement in Europe (Pascal,
La Rochefoucauld)&mdash;inner enfeeblement, discouragement, and
self-consumption of the non-gregarious man.</p>

<p>The perpetual process of laying stress upon mediocre qualities as being
the most valuable (modesty in rank and file, Nature converted into an
instrument).</p>

<p>Pangs of conscience associated with all that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>is self-glorifying and
original: thus follows the unhappiness&mdash;the <i>gloominess</i> of the world
from the standpoint of stronger and better-constituted men!</p>

<p>Gregarious consciousness and timorousness transferred to philosophy and
religion.</p>

<p>Let us leave the psychological impossibility of a purely unselfish
action out of consideration!</p>


<p class="parnum">390.</p>

<p>My ultimate conclusion is, that the <i>real</i> man represents a much
higher value than the "desirable" man of any ideal that has ever
existed hitherto; that all "desiderata" in regard to mankind have
been absurd and dangerous dissipations by means of which a particular
kind of man has sought to establish <i>his</i> measures of preservation
and of growth as a law for all; that every "desideratum" of this
kind which has been made to dominate has <i>reduced</i> man's worth, his
strength, and his trust in the future; that the indigence and mediocre
intellectuality of man becomes most apparent, even to-day, when he
reveals a <i>desire</i>; that man's ability to fix values has hitherto been
developed too inadequately to do justice to the actual, not merely
to the "desirable," <i>worth of man</i>; that, up to the present, ideals
have really been the power which has most slandered man and power, the
poisonous fumes which have hung over reality, and which have <i>seduced
men to yearn for nonentity</i>....</p>

not require misfortune, abstinence, and self-castigation as a necessary
means? And if the aim were to arrive at the <i>highest insight,</i> would
it not therefore be necessary to renounce all hope of an increase in
happiness, and to choose danger, adventure, mistrust, and seduction as
a road to enlightenment?... And suppose one will have happiness; maybe
one should join the ranks of the "poor in spirit."</p>


<p class="parnum">394.</p>



<p>The wholesale deception and fraud of so-called <i>moral improvement.</i></p>

<p>We do not believe that one man can be another if he is not that
other already&mdash;that is to say, if he is not, as often happens, an
accretion of personalities or at least of parts of persons. In this
case it is possible to draw another set of actions from him into the
foreground, and to drive back "the older man." ... The man's aspect
is altered, but <i>not</i> his actual nature.... It is but the merest
<i>factum brutum</i> that any one should cease from performing certain
actions, and the fact allows of the most varied interpretations.
Neither does it always follow therefrom that the habit of performing
a certain action is entirely arrested, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>nor that the reasons for
that action are dissipated. He whose destiny and abilities make him
a criminal never unlearns anything, but is continually adding to his
store of knowledge: and long abstinence acts as a sort of tonic on
his talent.... Certainly, as far as society is concerned, the only
interesting fact is that some one has ceased from performing certain
actions; and to this end society will often raise a man out of those
circumstances which make him <i>able</i> to perform those actions: this
is obviously a wiser course than that of trying to break his destiny
and his particular nature. The Church,&mdash;which has done nothing except
to take the place of, and to appropriate, the philosophic treasures
of antiquity,&mdash;starting out from another standpoint and wishing to
secure a "soul" or the "salvation" of a soul, believes in the expiatory
power of punishment, as also in the obliterating power of forgiveness:
both of which supposed processes are deceptions due to religious
prejudice&mdash;punishment expiates nothing, forgiveness obliterates
nothing; what is done cannot be undone. Because some one forgets
something it by no means proves that something has been wiped out....
An action leads to certain consequences, both among men and away from
men, and it matters not whether it has met with punishment, or whether
it has been "expiated," "forgiven," or "obliterated," it matters not
even if the Church meanwhile canonises the man who performed it. The
Church believes in things that do not exist, it believes in "Souls"; it
believes in "influences" that do not exist&mdash;in divine <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>influences; it
believes in states that do not exist, in sin, redemption, and spiritual
salvation: in all things it stops at the surface and is satisfied with
signs, attitudes, words, to which it lends an arbitrary interpretation.
It possesses a method of counterfeit psychology which is thought out
quite systematically.</p>


<p class="parnum">395.</p>

<p>"Illness makes men better," this famous assumption which is to be met
with in all ages, and in the mouth of the wizard quite as often as in
the mouth and maw of the people, really makes one ponder. In view of
discovering whether there is any truth in it, one might be allowed to
ask whether there is not perhaps a fundamental relationship between
morality and illness? Regarded as a whole, could not the "improvement
of mankind"&mdash;that is to say, the unquestionable softening, humanising,
and taming which the European has undergone within the last two
centuries&mdash;be regarded as the result of a long course of secret and
ghastly suffering, failure, abstinence, and grief? Has illness made
"Europeans" "better"? Or, put into other words, is not our modern
soft-hearted European morality, which could be likened to that of the
Chinese, perhaps an expression of physiological <i>deterioration</i>?...
It cannot be denied, for instance, that wherever history shows us
"man" in a state of particular glory and power, his type is always
dangerous, impetuous, and boisterous, and cares <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>little for humanity;
and perhaps, in those cases in which <i>it seems otherwise,</i> all that
was required was the courage or subtlety to see sufficiently below the
surface in psychological matters, in order even in them to discover the
general proposition: "the more healthy, strong, rich, fruitful, and
enterprising a man may feel, the more immoral he will be as well." A
terrible thought, to which one should on no account give way. Provided,
however, that one take a few steps forward with this thought, how
wondrous does the future then appear! What will then be paid for more
dearly on earth, than precisely this very thing which we are all trying
to promote, by all means in our power&mdash;the humanising, the improving,
and the increased "civilisation" of man? Nothing would then be more
expensive than virtue: for by means of it the world would ultimately
be turned into a hospital: and the last conclusion of wisdom would be,
"everybody must be everybody else's nurse." Then we should certainly
have attained to the "Peace on earth," so long desired! But how little
"joy we should find in each other's company"! How little beauty, wanton
spirits, daring, and danger! So few "actions" which would make life on
earth worth living! Ah! and no longer any "deeds"! But have not all the
<i>great</i> things and deeds which have remained fresh in the memory of
men, and which have not been destroyed by time, been <i>immoral</i> in the
deepest sense of the word?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">396.</p>

<p>The priests&mdash;and with them the half-priests or philosophers of all
ages&mdash;have always called that doctrine true, the educating influence
of which was a benevolent one or at least seemed so&mdash;that is to say,
tended to "improve." In this way they resemble an ingenuous plebeian
empiric and miracle-worker who, because he had tried a certain poison
as a cure, declared it to be no poison. "By their fruits ye shall know
them"&mdash;that is to say, "by our truths." This has been the reasoning
of priests until this day. They have squandered their sagacity, with
results that have been sufficiently fatal, in order to make the "proof
of power" (or the proof "by the fruits ") pre-eminent and even supreme
arbiter over all other forms of proof. "That which makes good must
be good; that which is good cannot lie"&mdash;these are their inexorable
conclusions&mdash;"that which bears good fruit must consequently be true;
there is no other criterion of truth." ...</p>

<p>But to the extent to which "improving" acts as an argument,
deteriorating must also act as a refutation. The error can be shown to
be an error, by examining the lives of those who represent it: a false
step, a vice can refute.... This indecent form of opposition, which
comes from below and behind&mdash;the doglike kind of attack, has not died
out either. Priests, as psychologists, never discovered anything more
interesting than spying out the secret vices of their adversaries&mdash;they
prove Christianity by looking about for the world's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>filth. They apply
this principle more particularly to the greatest on earth, to the
geniuses: readers will remember how Goethe has been attacked on every
conceivable occasion in Germany (Klopstock and Herder were among the
first to give a "good example" in this respect&mdash;birds of a feather
flock together).</p>


<p class="parnum">397.</p>

<p>One must be very immoral in order to <i>make people moral by deeds.</i> The
moralist's means are the most terrible that have ever been used; he
who has not the courage to be an immoralist in deeds may be fit for
anything else, but not for the duties of a moralist.</p>

<p>Morality is a menagerie; it assumes that iron bars may be more useful
than freedom, even for the creatures it imprisons; it also assumes that
there are animal-tamers about who do not shrink from terrible means,
and who are acquainted with the use of red-hot iron. This terrible
species, which enters into a struggle with the wild animal, is called
"priests."</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Man, incarcerated in an iron cage of errors, has become a caricature
of man; he is sick, emaciated, ill-disposed towards himself, filled
with a loathing of the impulses of life, filled with a mistrust of
all that is beautiful and happy in life&mdash;in fact, he is a wandering
monument of misery. How shall we ever succeed in vindicating this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
phenomenon&mdash;this artificial, arbitrary, and <i>recent</i> miscarriage&mdash;the
sinner&mdash;which the priests have bred on their territory?</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>In order to think fairly of morality, we must put two <i>biological</i>
notions in its place: the <i>taming</i> of the wild beasts, and the <i>rearing
of a particular species.</i></p>

<p>The priests of all ages have always pretended that they wished to
"<i>improve</i>" ... But we, of another persuasion, would laugh if a
lion-tamer ever wished to speak to us of his "improved" animals. As a
rule, the taming of a beast is only achieved by deteriorating it: even
the moral man is not a better man; he is rather a weaker member of his
species. But he is less harmful....</p>


<p class="parnum">398.</p>

<p>What I want to make clear, with all the means in my power, is:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>(a)</i> That there is no worse confusion than that which confounds
<i>rearing</i> and <i>taming</i>: and these two things have always been
confused.... Rearing, as I understand it, is a means of husbanding
the enormous powers of humanity in such a way that whole generations
may build upon the foundations laid by their progenitors&mdash;not only
outwardly, but inwardly, organically, developing from the already
existing stem and growing <i>stronger</i>....</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> That there is an exceptional danger in believing that mankind as
a whole is developing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>and growing stronger, if individuals are seen
to grow more feeble and more equally mediocre. Humanity&mdash;mankind&mdash;is
an abstract thing: the object of <i>rearing,</i> even in regard to the most
individual cases, can only be the <i>strong</i> man (the man who has no
breeding is weak, dissipated, and unstable).</p>


<hr />
<p class="title">6. Concluding Remarks Concerning the Criticism of Morality.</p>


<p class="parnum">399.</p>

<p>These are the things I demand of you&mdash;however badly they may sound in
your ears: that you subject moral valuations themselves to criticism.
That you should put a stop to your instinctive moral impulse&mdash;which in
this case demands submission and not criticism&mdash;with the question: "why
precisely submission?" That this yearning for a "why?"&mdash;for a criticism
of morality should not only be your present form of morality, but the
sublimest of all moralities, and an honour to the age you live in. That
your honesty, your will, may give an account of itself, and not deceive
you: "why not?"&mdash;Before what tribunal?</p>


<p class="parnum">400.</p>

<p>The three <i>postulates</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All that is ignoble is high (the protest of the "vulgar
man").</p>

<p>All that is contrary to Nature is high (the protest of the
physiologically botched).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
All that is of average worth is high (the protest of the
herd, of the "mediocre").</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus in the <i>history of morality</i> a <i>will to power</i> finds expression,
by means of which, either the slaves, the oppressed, the bungled and
the botched, those that suffer from themselves, or the mediocre,
attempt to make those valuations prevail which favour <i>their</i> existence.</p>

<p>From a biological standpoint, therefore, the phenomenon Morality is of
a highly suspicious nature. Up to the present, morality has developed
at the <i>cost</i> of: the ruling classes and their specific instincts,
the well-constituted and <i>beautiful</i> natures, the independent and
privileged classes in all respects.</p>

<p>Morality, then, is a sort of counter-movement opposing Nature's
endeavours to arrive at a <i>higher type.</i> Its effects are: mistrust of
life in general (in so far as its tendencies are felt to be immoral),
&mdash;hostility towards the senses (inasmuch as the highest values are
felt to be opposed to the higher instincts),&mdash;Degeneration and
self-destruction of "higher natures," because it is precisely in them
that the conflict becomes <i>conscious.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">401.</p>

<p><i>Which values have been paramount hitherto?</i></p>

<p>Morality as the leading value in all phases of philosophy (even with
the Sceptics). Result: this world is no good, a "true world" must exist
somewhere.</p>

<p>What is it that here determines the highest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>value? What, in sooth,
is morality? The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and
the disinherited who <i>take their revenge</i> in this way and play the
<i>masters</i>....</p>

<p>Historical proof: philosophers have always been decadents and always in
the pay of Nihilistic religions.</p>

<p>The instinct of decadence appears as the will to power. The
introduction of its system of means: its means are absolutely immoral.</p>

<p>General aspect: the values that have been highest hitherto have been a
special instance of the will to power; morality itself is a particular
instance of <i>immorality.</i></p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Why the Antagonistic Values always succumbed.</p>

<p>1. How was this actually <i>possible!</i> Question: why did life and
physiological well-constitutedness succumb everywhere? Why was there no
affirmative philosophy, no affirmative religion?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The historical signs of such movements: the pagan religion.
Dionysos <i>versus</i> the Christ. The Renaissance. Art.</p></blockquote>

<p>2. The strong and the weak: the healthy and the sick; the exception and
the rule. There is no doubt as to who is the stronger....</p>

<p><i>General view of history</i>; Is man an <i>exception</i> in the history of life
on this account?&mdash;An objection to <i>Darwinism.</i> The means wherewith
the weak succeed in ruling have become: instincts, "humanity,"
"institutions." ...</p>

<p>3. The proof of this rule on the part of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>weak is to be found in
our political instincts, in our social values, in our arts, and in our
<i>science.</i></p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>The <i>instincts of decadence</i> have become master of the <i>instincts of
ascending</i> life.... The <i>will to nonentity</i> has prevailed over the
<i>will to life</i>!</p>

<p>Is this <i>true</i>? is there not perhaps a stronger guarantee of life and
of the species in this victory of the weak and the mediocre?&mdash;is it
not perhaps only a means in the collective movement of life, a mere
slackening of the pace, a protective measure against something even
more dangerous?</p>

<p>Suppose the <i>strong</i> were masters in all respects, even in valuing:
let us try and think what their attitude would be towards illness,
suffering, and sacrifice! <i>Self-contempt on the part of the weak</i> would
be the result: they would do their utmost to disappear and to extirpate
their kind. And would this be <i>desirable</i>?&mdash;should we really like a
world in which the subtlety, the consideration, the intellectuality,
the <i>plasticity</i>&mdash;in fact, the whole influence of the weak&mdash;was
lacking?<a name="FNanchor_9_16" id="FNanchor_9_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_16" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
We have seen two "wills to power" at war <i>(in this special case we
had a principle</i>: that of agreeing with the one that has hitherto
succumbed, and of disagreeing with the one that has hitherto
triumphed): we have recognised the "real world" as a "<i>world of lies</i>"
and morality as a <i>form of immorality.</i> We do <i>not</i> say "the stronger
is wrong."</p>

<p>We have understood <i>what</i> it is that has determined the highest values
hitherto, and <i>why</i> the latter should have prevailed over the opposite
value: it was numerically the <i>stronger</i>.</p>

<p>If we now purify <i>the opposite value</i> of the infection, the
half-heartedness, <i>and the degeneration,</i> with which we identify it, we
restore Nature to the throne, free from moralic acid.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_16" id="Footnote_9_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_16"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.&mdash;We realise here the great difference
between Nietzsche and those who draw premature conclusions from
Darwinism. There is no brutal solution of modern problems in
Nietzsche's philosophy. He did not advocate anything so ridiculous as
the total suppression of the weak and the degenerate. What he wished to
resist and to overthrow <i>was their supremacy, their excessive power.</i>
He felt that there was a desirable and stronger type which was in need
of having its hopes, aspirations, and instincts upheld in defiance of
Christian values.</p></div>


<p class="parnum">402.</p>

<p><i>Morality,</i> a useful error; or, more clearly still, a necessary and
expedient lie according to the greatest and most impartial of its
supporters.</p>


<p class="parnum">403.</p>

<p>One ought to be able to acknowledge the truth up to that point where
one is sufficiently elevated no longer to require the <i>disciplinary
school of moral error.</i>&mdash;When one judges life morally, it <i>disgusts</i>
one.</p>

<p>Neither should false personalities be invented; one should not say, for
instance, "Nature is cruel." It is precisely when one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>perceives <i>that
there is no such central controlling and responsible force that one is
relieved!</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Evolution of man.</i> A. He tried to attain to a certain power
over Nature and over himself. (Morality was necessary in
order to make man triumph in his struggle with Nature and
"wild animals.")</p>

<p>B. If power over Nature has been attained, this power can
be used as a help in our development: Will to Power as a
self-enhancing and self-strengthening principle.</p></blockquote>


<p class="parnum">404.</p>

<p>Morality may be regarded as the <i>illusion of a species,</i> fostered with
the view of urging the individual to sacrifice himself to the future,
and seemingly granting him such a very great value, that with that
<i>self-consciousness</i> he may tyrannise over, and constrain, other sides
of his nature, and find it difficult to be pleased with himself.</p>

<p>We ought to be most profoundly thankful for what morality has done
hitherto: <i>but now it is no more than a burden</i> which may prove fatal.
<i>Morality itself</i> in the form of honesty urges us to deny morality.</p>


<p class="parnum">405.</p>

<p>To what extent is the <i>self-destruction of morality</i> still a sign of
its own strength? We Europeans have within us the blood of those who
were ready to die for their faith; we have taken morality <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>frightfully
seriously, and there is nothing which we have not, at one time,
sacrificed to it. On the other hand, our intellectual subtlety has
been reached essentially through the vivisection of our consciences.
We do not yet know the "whither" towards which we are urging our
steps, now that we have departed from the soil of our forebears. But
it was on this very soil that we acquired the strength which is now
driving us from our homes in search of adventure, and it is thanks
to that strength that we are now in mid-sea, surrounded by untried
possibilities and things undiscovered&mdash;we can no longer choose, we must
be conquerors, now that we have no land in which we feel at home and
in which we would fain "survive." A concealed "<i>yea</i>" is driving us
forward, and it is stronger than all our "nays." Even our <i>strength</i> no
longer bears with us in the old swampy land: we venture out into the
open, we attempt the task. The world is still rich and undiscovered,
and even to perish were better than to be half-men or poisonous men.
Our very strength itself urges us to take to the sea; there where all
suns have hitherto sunk we know of a new world....</p>

<p class="title2">CRITICISM OF PHILOSOPHY.</p>

<hr />
<p class="title">1. General Remarks.</p>



<p class="parnum">406.</p>

<p>Let us rid ourselves of a few superstitions which heretofore have been
fashionable among philosophers!</p>


<p class="parnum">407.</p>

<p>Philosophers are prejudiced <i>against</i> appearance, change, pain, death,
the things of the body, the senses, fate, bondage, and all that which
has no purpose.</p>

<p>In the first place, they believe in: absolute knowledge, (2) in
knowledge for its own sake,</p>

<p>(3) in virtue and happiness as necessarily related,</p>

<p>(4) in the recognisability of men's acts. They are led by instinctive
determinations of values, in which <i>former</i> cultures are reflected
(more dangerous cultures too).</p>


<p class="parnum">408.</p>

<p>What have philosophers <i>lacked</i>! (1) A sense of history, (2) a
knowledge of physiology, (3) a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>goal in the future.&mdash;The ability to
criticise without irony or moral condemnation.</p>


<p class="parnum">409.</p>

<p>Philosophers have had (1) from times immemorial a wonderful capacity
for the <i>contradictio in adjecto,</i> (2) they have always trusted
concepts as unconditionally as they have mistrusted the senses: it
never seems to have occurred to them that notions and words are our
inheritance of past ages in which thinking was neither very clear nor
very exact.</p>

<p>What seems to dawn upon philosophers last of all: that they must
no longer allow themselves to be presented with concepts already
conceived, nor must they merely purify and polish up those concepts;
but they must first <i>make</i> them, <i>create</i> them, themselves, and
then present them and get people to accept them. Up to the present,
people have trusted their concepts generally, as if they had been a
wonderful <i>dowry</i> from some kind of wonderland: but they constitute
the inheritance of our most remote, most foolish, and most intelligent
forefathers. This <i>piety</i> towards that <i>which already exists in us</i>
is perhaps related to the <i>moral element in science.</i> What we needed
above all is absolute scepticism towards all traditional concepts (like
that which a certain philosopher may already have possessed&mdash;and he was
Plato, of course: for he taught <i>the reverse</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">410.</p>

<p>Profoundly mistrustful towards the dogmas of the theory of knowledge,
I liked to look now out of this window, now out of that, though I took
good care not to become finally fixed anywhere, indeed I should have
thought it dangerous to have done so&mdash;though finally: is it within the
range of probabilities for an instrument to criticise its own fitness?
What I noticed more particularly was, that no scientific scepticism or
dogmatism has ever arisen quite free from all <i>arrières pensées</i>&mdash;that
it has only a secondary value as soon as the motive lying immediately
behind it is discovered.</p>

<p>Fundamental aspect: Kant's, Hegel's, Schopenhauer's, the sceptical and
epochistical, the historifying and the pessimistic attitudes&mdash;all have
a <i>moral</i> origin. I have found no one who has dared to <i>criticise the
moral valuations,</i> and I soon turned my back upon the meagre attempts
that have been made to describe the evolution of these feelings (by
English and German Darwinians).</p>

<p>How can Spinoza's position, his denial and repudiation of the moral
values, be explained? (It was the result of his Theodicy!)</p>


<p class="parnum">411.</p>

<p><i>Morality regarded as the highest form of protection.</i>&mdash;Our world is
<i>either</i> the work and expression (the <i>modus</i>) of God, in which case
it must be <i>in the highest degree perfect</i> (Leibnitz's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>conclusion
...),&mdash;and no one doubted that he knew what perfection must be
like,&mdash;and then all evil can only be <i>apparent</i> (Spinoza is <i>more
radical,</i> he says this of good and evil), or it must be a part of God's
high purpose (a consequence of a particularly great mark of favour
on God's part, who thus allows man to choose between good and evil:
the privilege of being no automaton; "freedom," with the ever-present
danger of making a mistake and of choosing wrongly.... See Simplicius,
for instance, in the commentary to Epictetus).</p>

<p><i>Or</i> our world is imperfect; evil and guilt are real, determined, and
are absolutely inherent to its being; in that case it cannot be the
<i>real</i> world: consequently knowledge can only be a way of denying
the world, for the latter is error which may be recognised as such.
This is Schopenhauer's opinion, based upon Kantian first principles.
Pascal was still more desperate: he thought that even knowledge must be
corrupt and false&mdash;that <i>revelation</i> is a necessity if only in order to
recognise that the world should be denied....</p>


<p class="parnum">412.</p>

<p>Owing to our habit of believing in unconditional authorities, we have
grown to feel a profound need for them: indeed, this feeling is so
strong that, even in an age of criticism such as Kant's was, it showed
itself to be superior to the need for criticism, and, in a certain
sense, was able to subject the whole work of critical acumen, and to
convert it to its own use. It proved its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>superiority once more in
the generation which followed, and which, owing to its historical
instincts, naturally felt itself drawn to a relative view of all
authority, when it converted even the Hegelian philosophy of evolution
(history rechristened and called philosophy) to its own use, and
represented history as being the self-revelation and self-surpassing
of moral ideas. Since Plato, philosophy has lain under the dominion of
morality. Even in Plato's predecessors, moral interpretations play a
most important rôle (Anaximander declares that all things are made to
perish as a punishment for their departure from pure being; Heraclitus
thinks that the regularity of phenomena is a proof of the morally
correct character of evolution in general).</p>


<p class="parnum">413.</p>

<p>The progress of philosophy has been hindered most seriously hitherto
through the influence of moral <i>arrières-pensées.</i></p>

<p>In all ages, "fine feelings" have been regarded as arguments, "heaving
breasts" have been the bellows of godliness, convictions have been the
"criteria" of truth, and the need of opposition has been the note of
interrogation affixed to wisdom. This falseness and fraud permeates
the whole history of philosophy. But for a few respected sceptics,
no instinct for intellectual Uprightness is to be found anywhere.
Finally, <i>Kant</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>guilelessly sought to make this thinker's corruption
scientific by means of his concept, "<i>practical reason</i>". He expressly
invented a reason which, in certain cases, would allow one <i>not</i> to
bother about reason&mdash;that is to say, in cases where the heart's desire,
morality, or "duty" are the motive power.</p>

<p><i>Hegel</i>: his popular side, the doctrine of war and of great men. Right
is on the side of the victorious: he (the victorious man) stands for
the progress of mankind. His is an attempt at proving the dominion of
morality by means of history.</p>

<p>Kant: a kingdom of moral values withdrawn from us, invisible, real.</p>

<p>Hegel: a demonstrable process of evolution, the actualisation of the
kingdom of morality.</p>

<p>We shall not allow ourselves to be deceived either in Kant's or Hegel's
way:&mdash;We no longer <i>believe,</i> as they did, in morality, and therefore
have no philosophies to found with the view of justifying morality.
Criticism and history have no charm for us <i>in this</i> respect: what is
their charm, then?</p>

<p>The importance of German philosophy (<i>Hegel,</i>) the thinking out of a
kind of <i>pantheism</i> which would not reckon evil, error, and suffering
as arguments against godliness. <i>This grand initiative</i> was misused
by the powers that were (State, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>etc.) to sanction the rights of the
people that happened to be paramount.</p>

<p><i>Schopenhauer</i> appears as a stubborn opponent of this idea; he is a
moral man who, in order to keep in the right concerning his moral
valuation, finally becomes a <i>denier of the world.</i> Ultimately he
becomes a "mystic."</p>

<p>I myself have sought an <i>æsthetic</i> justification of the ugliness in
this world. I regarded the desire for beauty and for the persistence
of certain forms as a temporary preservative and recuperative measure:
what seemed to me to be fundamentally associated with pain, however,
was the eternal lust of creating and the <i>eternal compulsion to
destroy.</i></p>

<p>We call things ugly when we look at them with the desire of attributing
some sense, some <i>new</i> sense, to what has become senseless: it is the
accumulated power of the creator which compels him to regard what has
existed hitherto as no longer acceptable, botched, worthy of being
suppressed&mdash;ugly!</p>

<p><i>My first solution of the problem: Dionysian wisdom. The joy in the

undoing, regarded as the joy over what is <i>coming and what lies in the

be.</i> Dionysian: temporary identification with the principle of life

<p><i>My innovations.</i> The Development of Pessimism: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>intellectual

Knowledge, a sign of <i>decay,</i> veils by means of an illusion all strong

<p>(3) <i>I therefore travelled farther along the road of dissolution&mdash;and
along it I found new sources of strength for individuals.</i> We <i>must
be destroyers</i>!&mdash;I perceived that the state of <i>dissolution is one
in which individual beings are able to arrive at a kind of perfection
not possible hitherto, it is an image and isolated example of life
in general.</i> To the paralysing feeling of general dissolution and
imperfection, I opposed the <i>Eternal Recurrence.</i></p>

<p>People naturally seek the picture of life in <i>that</i> philosophy which
makes them most cheerful&mdash;that is to say, in that philosophy which
gives the highest sense of freedom to <i>their strongest instinct.</i> This
is probably the case with me.</p>


<p class="parnum">419.</p>

<p>German philosophy, as a whole,&mdash;Leibnitz, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, to
mention the greatest,&mdash;is the most out-and-out <i>form of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>romanticism</i>
and home-sickness that has ever yet existed: it is a yearning for the
best that has ever been known on earth. One is at home nowhere; that
which is ultimately yearned after is a place where one can somehow
feel at home; because one has been at home there before, and that
place is the <i>Greek</i> world! But it is precisely in that direction
that airbridges are broken down<i>&mdash;save,</i> of course, the rainbow
of concepts! And the latter lead everywhere, to all the homes and
"fatherlands" that ever existed for Greek souls! Certainly, one must be
very light and thin in order to cross these bridges! But what happiness
lies even in this desire for spirituality, almost for ghostliness!
With it, how far one is from the "press and bustle" and the mechanical
boorishness of the natural sciences, how far from the vulgar din
of "modern ideas"! One wants to get back to the Greeks <i>via</i> the
Fathers of the Church, from North to South, from formulæ to forms; the
passage out of antiquity&mdash;Christianity&mdash;is still a source of joy as a
means of access to antiquity, as a portion of the old world itself,
as a glistening mosaic of ancient concepts and ancient valuations.
Arabesques, scroll-work, rococo of scholastic abstractions&mdash;always
better, that is to say, finer and more slender, than the peasant and
plebeian reality of Northern Europe, and still a protest on the part
of higher intellectuality against the peasant war and insurrection
of the mob which have become master of the intellectual taste of
Northern Europe, and which had its leader in a man as great and
unintellectual as Luther:&mdash;in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>this respect German philosophy belongs
to the Counter-Reformation, it might even be looked upon as related
to the Renaissance, or at least to the will to Renaissance, the will
to get ahead with the discovery of antiquity, with the excavation of
ancient philosophy, and above all of pre-Socratic philosophy&mdash;the
most thoroughly dilapidated of all Greek temples! Possibly, in à few
hundred years, people will be of the opinion that all German philosophy
derived its dignity from this fact, that step by step it attempted
to reclaim the soil of antiquity, and that therefore all demands for
"originality" must appear both petty and foolish when compared with
Germany's higher claim to having refastened the bonds which seemed for
ever rent&mdash;the bonds which bound us to the Greeks, the highest type
of "men" ever evolved hitherto. To-day we are once more approaching
all the fundamental principles of the cosmogony which the Greek mind
in Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Democritus, and
Anaxagoras, was responsible for. Day by day we are growing more
<i>Greek</i>; at first, as is only natural, the change remains confined to
concepts and valuations, and we hover around like Greasing spirits: but
it is to be hoped that some day our <i>body</i> will also be involved! Here
lies (and has always lain) my hope for the German nation.</p>


<p class="parnum">420.</p>

<p>I do not wish to convert anybody to philosophy: it is both necessary
and perhaps desirable that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>philosopher should be a <i>rare</i>
plant. Nothing is more repugnant to me than the scholarly praise of
philosophy which is to be found in Seneca and Cicero. Philosophy
has not much in common with virtue. I trust I may be allowed to say
that even the scientific man is a fundamentally different person
from the philosopher. What I most desire is, that the genuine notion
"philosopher" should not completely perish in Germany. There are so
many incomplete creatures in Germany already who would fain conceal
their ineptitude beneath such noble names.</p>


<p class="parnum">421.</p>

<p>I must <i>set up the highest ideal of a philosopher.</i> Learning is not
everything! The scholar is the sheep in the kingdom of learning; he
studies because he is told to do so, and because others have done so
before him.</p>


<p class="parnum">422.</p>

<p>The superstition concerning <i>philosophers</i>: They are confounded with
men <i>of science.</i> As if the value of things were inherent in them
and required only to be held on to tightly! To what extent are their
researches carried on under the influence of values which already
prevail (their hatred of appearance of the body, etc.)? Schopenhauer
concerning morality (scorn of Utilitarianism). Ultimately the confusion
goes so far that Darwinism is regarded as philosophy, and thus at the
present day power has gone over to the men of <i>science.</i> Even Frenchmen
like Taine prosecute <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>research, or mean to prosecute research,
<i>without</i> being already in possession of a standard of valuation.
Prostration before "facts" of a kind of cult. As a matter of fact, they
<i>destroy</i> the existing valuations.</p>

<p>The <i>explanation</i> of this misunderstanding. The man who is able to
command is a rare phenomenon; he misinterprets himself. What one
<i>wants</i> to do, above all, is to disclaim all authority and to attribute
it to <i>circumstances.</i> In Germany the critic's estimations belong to
the history of awakening <i>manhood.</i> Lessing, etc. (Napoleon concerning
Goethe). As a matter of fact, the movement is again made retrograde
owing to German romanticism: and the <i>fame</i> of German philosophy
relies upon it as if it dissipated the danger of scepticism and could
<i>demonstrate faith.</i> Both tendencies culminate in Hegel: at bottom,
what he did was to generalise the fact of German criticism and the
fact of German romanticism,&mdash;a kind of dialectical fatalism, but to
the honour of intellectuality, with the actual submission of the
philosopher to reality. <i>The critic prepares the way</i>: that is all!</p>

<p>With Schopenhauer the philosopher's mission dawns; it is felt that
the object is to determine <i>values</i>; still under the dominion of
eudemonism. The ideal of Pessimism.</p>


<p class="parnum">423.</p>

<p><i>Theory and practice.</i>&mdash;This is a pernicious distinction, as if there
were an <i>instinct of knowledge,</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>which, without inquiring into the
utility or harmfulness of a thing, blindly charged at the truth; and
then that, apart from this instinct, there were the whole world of
<i>practical</i> interests.</p>

<p>In contradiction of this, I try to show what instincts are active
behind all these <i>pure</i> theorists,&mdash;and how the latter, as a whole,
under the dominion of their instincts, fatally make for something
which <i>to their minds</i> is "truth," to their minds and <i>only</i> to their
minds. The struggle between systems, together with the struggle between
epistemological scruples, is one which involves very special instincts
(forms of vitality, of decline, of classes, of races, etc.).</p>

<p>The so-called <i>thirst for knowledge</i> may be traced to the <i>lust of
appropriation</i> and of <i>conquest</i>: in obedience to this lust the
senses, memory, and the instincts, etc., were developed. The quickest
possible reduction of the phenomena, economy, the accumulation of spoil
from the world of knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> that portion of the world which has
been appropriated and made manageable)....</p>

<p>Morality is therefore such a curious science, because it is in the
highest degree <i>practical</i>: the purely scientific position, scientific
uprightness, is thus immediately abandoned, as soon as morality calls
for replies to its questions. Morality says: I <i>require</i> certain
answers&mdash;reasons, arguments; scruples may come afterwards, or they may
not come at all.</p>

<p>"How must one act?" If one considers that one is dealing with a
supremely evolved type&mdash;a type which has been "dealt with" for
countless thousands of years, and in which everything has become
instinct, expediency, automatism, fatality, the <i>urgency</i> of this moral
question seems rather funny.</p>

<p>"How must one act?" Morality has always been a subject of
misunderstanding: as a matter of fact, a certain species, which was
constituted to act in a certain way, wished to justify itself by
<i>making</i> its norm paramount.</p>

<p>"How must one act?" this is not a cause, but an <i>effect.</i> Morality
follows, the ideal comes first....</p>

<p>On the other hand, the appearance of moral scruples (or in other
words, <i>the coming to consciousness of the values</i> which guide action)
betray a certain <i>morbidness</i>; strong ages and people do not ponder
over their rights, nor over the principles of action, over instinct or
over reason. <i>Consciousness</i> is a sign that the real morality&mdash;that
is to say, the certainty of instinct which leads to a definite
course of action&mdash;is going to the dogs.... Every time a new <i>world
of consciousness</i> is created, the moralists are signs of a lesion,
of impoverishment and of disorganisation. Those who are <i>deeply
instinctive</i> fear bandying words over duties: among them are found
pyrrhonic opponents of dialectics and of knowableness in general.... A
virtue is <i>refuted</i> with a "for." ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
<i>Thesis</i>: The appearance of moralists belongs to periods when morality
is declining.</p>

<p><i>Thesis</i>: The moralist is a dissipator of moral instincts, however much
he may appear to be their restorer.</p>

<p><i>Thesis</i>: That which really prompts the action of a moralist is not a
moral instinct, but the <i>instincts of decadence,</i> translated into the
forms of morality (he regards the growing uncertainty of the instincts
as <i>corruption</i>).</p>

<p><i>Thesis</i>: The <i>instincts of decadence</i> which, thanks to moralists, wish
to become master of the instinctive morality of stronger races and
ages, are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The instincts of the weak and of the botched;</p>

<p>(2) The instincts of the exceptions, of the anchorites, of the
unhinged, of the abortions of quality or of the reverse;</p>

<p>(3) The instincts of the habitually suffering, who require a noble
interpretation of their condition, and who therefore require to be as
poor physiologists as possible.</p>

<p>The humbug of the <i>scientific spirit.</i>&mdash;One should not affect the
spirit of science, when the time to be scientific is not yet at
hand; but even the genuine investigator has to abandon vanity, and
has to affect a certain kind of method which is not yet seasonable.
Neither should we falsify things and thoughts, which we have arrived
at differently, by means of a false arrangement of deduction and
dialectics. It is thus that Kant in his "morality" falsifies his
inner tendency to psychology; a more modern example of the same thing
is Herbert Spencer's <i>Ethics.</i> A man should neither conceal nor
misrepresent the <i>facts</i> concerning the way in which he conceived his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
thoughts. The deepest and most inexhaustible books will certainly
always have something of the aphoristic and impetuous character of
Pascal's <i>Pensées</i>. The motive forces and valuations have lain long
below the surface; that which comes uppermost is their effect.</p>

<p>I guard against all the humbug of a false scientific spirit:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) In respect of the manner of <i>demonstration,</i> if it does not
correspond to the genesis of the thoughts;</p>

<p>(2) In respect of the demands for <i>methods</i> which, at a given period in
science, may be quite impossible;</p>

<p>(3) In respect of the demand for <i>objectivity</i> for cold impersonal
treatment, where, as in the case of all valuations, we describe
ourselves and our intimate experiences in a couple of words. There
are ludicrous forms of vanity, as, for instance, Sainte-Beuve's. He
actually worried himself all his life because he had shown some warmth
or passion either "<i>pro</i>" or "con," and he would fein have lied that
fact out of his life.</p>


<p class="parnum">425.</p>

<p>"Objectivity" in the philosopher: moral indifference in regard to one's
self, blindness in regard to either favourable or fetal circumstances.
Unscrupulousness in the use of dangerous means; perversity and
complexity of character considered as an advantage and exploited.</p>

<p>My profound indifference to myself: I refuse <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>to derive any advantage
from my knowledge, nor do I wish to escape any disadvantages which it
may entail.&mdash;I include among these disadvantages that which is called
the <i>perversion</i> of character; this prospect is beside the point: I use
my character, but I try neither to understand it nor to change it&mdash;the
personal calculation of virtue has not entered my head once. It strikes
me that one closes the doors of knowledge as soon as one becomes
interested in one's own personal case&mdash;or even in the "Salvation of
one's soul"!... One should not take one's morality too seriously, nor
should one forfeit a modest right to the opposite of morality....</p>

<p>A sort of <i>heritage of morality</i> is perhaps presupposed here: one
feels that one can be lavish with it and fling a great deal of it out
of the window without materially reducing one's means. One is never
tempted to admire "beautiful souls," one always knows one's self to be
their superior. The monsters of virtue should be met with inner scorn;
<i>déniaiser la vertu</i>&mdash;Oh, the joy of it!</p>

<p>One should revolve round one's self, have no desire to be "better" or
"anything else" at all than one is. One should be too interested to
omit throwing the tentacles or meshes of every morality out to things.</p>


<p class="parnum">426.</p>

<p>Concerning the psychology of <i>philosophers.</i> They should be
psychologists&mdash;this was possible only from the nineteenth century
onwards&mdash;and no longer little Jack Homers, who see three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
feet in front of them, and are almost satisfied to burrow inside
themselves. We psychologists of the future are not very intent on
self-contemplation: we regard it almost as a sign of degeneration when
an instrument endeavours "to know itself":<a name="FNanchor_10_17" id="FNanchor_10_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_17" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we are instruments of
knowledge and we would fain possess all the precision and ingenuousness
of an instrument&mdash;consequently we may not analyse or "know" ourselves.
The first sign of a great psychologist's self-preservative instinct:
he never goes in search of himself, he has no eye, no interest, no
inquisitiveness where he himself is concerned.... The great egoism
of our dominating will insists on our completely shutting our eyes to
ourselves, and on our appearing "impersonal," "disinterested"!&mdash;Oh to
what a ridiculous degree we are the reverse of this!</p>

<p>We are no Pascals, we are not particularly interested in the
"Salvation of the soul," in our own happiness, and in our own
virtue.&mdash;We have neither enough time nor enough curiosity to be so
concerned with ourselves. Regarded more deeply, the case is again
different, we thoroughly mistrust all men who thus contemplate their
own navels: because introspection seems to us a degenerate form of
the psychologist's genius, as a note of interrogation affixed to the
psychologist's instinct: just as a painter's eye is degenerate which is
actuated by the <i>will</i> to see for the sake of seeing.</p>

<p class="title">2. A Criticism of Greek Philosophy.</p>


<p class="parnum">427.</p>

<p>The apparition of Greek philosophers since the time of Socrates is a
symptom of decadence; the anti-Hellenic instincts become paramount.</p>

<p>The "<i>Sophist</i>" is still quite Hellenic&mdash;as are also Anaxagoras,
Democritus, and the great Ionians; but only as transitional forms. The
<i>polis</i> loses its faith in the unity of its culture, in its rights of
dominion over every other <i>polis....</i> Cultures, that is to say, "the
gods," are exchanged, and thus the belief in the exclusive prerogative
of the <i>deus autochthonus</i> is lost. Good and Evil of whatever origin
get mixed: the boundaries separating good from evil gradually
<i>vanish....</i> This is the "Sophist." ...</p>

<p>On the other hand, the "philosopher" is the <i>reactionary</i>: he insists
upon the <i>old</i> virtues. He sees the reason of decay in the decay of
institutions: he therefore wishes to revive <i>old</i> institutions;&mdash;he
sees decay in the decline of authority: he therefore endeavours to
find <i>new</i> authorities (he travels abroad, explores foreign literature
and exotic religions....);&mdash;he will reinstate the <i>ideal polis,</i> after
the concept "polis" has become superannuated (just, as the Jews kept
themselves together as a "people" after they had fallen into slavery).
They become interested in all tyrants: their desire is to re-establish
virtue with "<i>force majeure</i>".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Gradually everything <i>genuinely Hellenic</i> is held responsible for
the state of <i>decay</i> (and Plato is just as ungrateful to Pericles,
Homer, tragedy, and rhetoric as the prophets are to David and
Saul). <i>The downfall of Greece is conceived as an objection to the
fundamental principles of Hellenic culture: the profound error of
philosophers</i>&mdash;Conclusion: the Greek world perishes. The cause thereof:
Homer, mythology, ancient morality, etc.</p>

<p>The anti-Hellenic development of philosophers' valuations:&mdash;the
Egyptian influence ("Life after death" made into law....);&mdash;the Semitic
influence (the "dignity of the sage," the "Sheik");&mdash;the Pythagorean
influence, the subterranean cults, Silence, means of terrorisation
consisting of appeals to a "Beyond," <i>mathematics</i>: the religious
valuation consisting of a sort of intimacy with a cosmic entity;&mdash;the
sacerdotal, ascetic, and transcendental influences;&mdash;the <i>dialectical</i>
influence,&mdash;I am of opinion that even Plato already betrays revolting
and pedantic meticulousness in his concepts!&mdash;Decline of good
intellectual taste: the hateful noisiness of every kind of direct
dialectics seems no longer to be felt.</p>

<p>The <i>two</i> decadent tendencies and extremes run side by side: (a) the
luxuriant and more charming kind of decadence which shows a love of
pomp and art, and (b) the gloomy kind, with its religious and moral
pathos, its stoical self-hardening tendency, its Platonic denial of the
senses, and its preparation of the soil for the coming of Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">428.</p>

<p>To what extent psychologists have been corrupted by the moral
idiosyncrasy!&mdash;Not one of the ancient philosophers had the courage to
advance the theory of the non-free will (that is to say, the theory
that denies morality);&mdash;not one had the courage to identify the typical
feature of happiness, of every kind of happiness **("pleasure"), with the
will to power: for the pleasure of power was considered immoral;&mdash;not
one had the courage to regard virtue as a <i>result of immorality</i> (as a
result of a will to power) in the service of a species (or of a race,
or of a <i>polis</i>); for the will to power was considered immoral.</p>

<p>In the whole of moral evolution, there is no sign of truth: all
the conceptual elements which come into play are fictions; all the
psychological tenets are false; all the forms of logic employed in this
department of prevarication are sophisms. The chief feature of all
moral philosophers is their total lack of intellectual cleanliness and
self-control: they regard "fine feelings" as arguments: their heaving
breasts seem to them the bellows of godliness.... Moral philosophy is
the most suspicious period in the history of the human intellect.</p>

<p>The first great example: in the name of morality and under its
patronage, a great wrong was committed, which as a matter of fact was
in every respect an act of decadence. Sufficient stress cannot be laid
upon this fact, that the great Greek philosophers not only represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the decadence of <i>every kind of Greek ability</i>, but also made it
<i>contagious</i>.... This "virtue" made wholly abstract was the highest
form of seduction; to make oneself abstract means to turn one's back on
the world.</p>

<p>The moment is a very remarkable one: the Sophists are within sight
of the first <i>criticism of morality,</i> the first <i>knowledge</i> of
morality:&mdash;they classify the majority of moral valuations (in view
of their dependence upon local conditions) together;&mdash;they lead one
to understand that every form of morality is capable of being upheld
dialectically: that is to say, they guessed that all the fundamental
principles of a morality must be <i>sophistical</i>&mdash;a proposition which
was afterwards proved in the grandest possible style by the ancient
philosophers from Plato onwards (up to Kant);&mdash;they postulate the
primary truth that there is no such thing as a "moral <i>per se</i>," a
"good <i>per se</i>," and that it is madness to talk of "truth" in this
respect.</p>

<p>Wherever was <i>intellectual uprightness</i> to be found in those days?</p>

<p>The Greek culture of the Sophists had grown out of all the Greek
instincts; it belongs to the culture of the age of Pericles as
necessarily as Plato does not: it has its predecessors in Heraclitus,
Democritus, and in the scientific types of the old philosophy; it
finds expression in the elevated culture of Thucydides, for instance.
And&mdash;it has ultimately shown itself to be right: every step in the
science of epistemology and morality has <i>confirmed the attitude</i> of
the Sophists.... Our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>modern attitude of mind is, to a great extent,
Heraclitean, Democritean, and Protagorean ... to say that it is
<i>Protagorean</i> is even sufficient: because Protagoras was in himself a
synthesis of the two men Heraclitus and Democritus.</p>

<p>(<i>Plato</i>: a <i>great Cagliostro,</i>&mdash;let us think of how Epicurus judged
him; how Timon, Pyrrho's friend, judged him&mdash;&mdash;Is Plato's integrity by
any chance beyond question?... But we at least know what he wished to
have <i>taught</i> as absolute truth&mdash;namely, things which were to him not
even relative truths: the separate and immortal life of "souls.")</p>

<p>The <i>Sophists</i> are nothing more, nor less than realists: they elevate
all the values and practices which are common property to the rank of
values&mdash;they have the courage, peculiar to all strong intellects,
which consists in <i>knowing</i> their immorality....</p>

<p>Is it to be supposed that these small Greek independent republics,
so filled with rage and envy that they would fain have devoured each
other, were led by principles of humanity and honesty? Is Thucydides
by any chance reproached with the words he puts into the mouths of
the Athenian ambassadors when they were treating with the Melii anent
the question of destruction or submission? Only the most perfect
Tartuffes could have been able to speak of virtue in the midst of that
dreadful strain&mdash;or if not Tartuffes, at least <i>detached philosophers,</i>
anchorites, exiles, and fleers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>from reality.... All of them, people
who denied things in order to be able to exist.</p>

<p>The Sophists were Greeks: when Socrates and Plato adopted the cause
of virtue and justice, they were <i>Jews</i> or I know not what. <i>Grote's</i>
tactics in the defence of the Sophists are false: he would like to
raise them to the rank of men of honour and moralisers&mdash;but it was
their honour not to indulge in any humbug with grand words and virtues.</p>


<p class="parnum">430.</p>

<p>The great reasonableness underlying all moral education lay in the fact
that it always attempted to attain to <i>the certainty of an instinct</i>:
so that neither good intentions nor good means, as such, first required
to enter consciousness. Just as the soldier learns his exercises, so
should man learn how to act in life. In truth this unconsciousness
belongs to every kind of perfection: even the mathematician carries out
his calculations unconsciously....</p>

<p>What, then, does Socrates' <i>reaction</i> mean, which recommended
dialectics as the way to virtue, and which was charmed when morality
was unable to justify itself logically? But this is precisely what
proves its <i>superiority</i>&mdash;without unconsciousness <i>it is worth nothing</i>!</p>

<p>In reality it means <i>the dissolution of Greek instincts,</i> when
<i>demonstrability</i> is posited as the first condition of personal
excellence in virtue. All these great "men of virtue" and of words are
themselves types of dissolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
In practice, it means that moral judgments have been torn from the
conditions among which they grew and in which alone they had some
sense, from their Greek and Græco-political soil, in order to be
<i>denaturalised</i> under the cover of being <i>made sublime.</i> The great
concepts "good" and "just" are divorced from the first principles of
which they form a part, and, as "ideas" <i>become free,</i> degenerate
into subjects for discussion. A certain truth is sought behind them;
they are regarded as entities or as symbols of entities: a world is
<i>invented</i> where they are "at home," and from which they are supposed
to hail.</p>

<p><i>In short</i>: the scandal reaches its apotheosis in Plato.... And then it
was necessary to invent the <i>perfectly abstract</i> man also:&mdash;good, just,
wise, and a dialectician to boot&mdash;in short, the <i>scarecrow</i> of the
ancient philosopher: a plant without any soil whatsoever; a human race
devoid of all definite ruling instincts; a virtue which "justifies"
itself with reasons. The perfectly absurd "individual" <i>per se</i>! the
highest form of <i>Artificiality....</i></p>

<p>Briefly, the denaturalisation of moral values resulted in the creation
of a degenerate <i>type of man</i>&mdash;"the good man," "the happy man,"
"the wise man."&mdash;Socrates represents a moment of the most <i>profound
perversity</i> in the history of values.</p>


<p class="parnum">431.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i>&mdash;This veering round of Greek taste in favour of dialectics
is a great question. What <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>really happened then? Socrates, the
<i>roturier</i> who was responsible for it, was thus able to triumph over
a more noble taste, the taste of <i>the noble</i>:&mdash;the mob gets the upper
hand along with dialectics. Previous to Socrates dialectic manners
were repudiated in good society; they were regarded as indecent; the
youths were Warned against them. What was the purpose of this display
of reasons? Why demonstrate? Against others one could use authority.
One commanded, and that sufficed. Among friends, <i>inter pares,</i> there
was tradition&mdash;<i>also</i> a form of authority: and last but not least,
one understood each other. There was no room found for dialectics.
Besides, all such modes of presenting reasons were distrusted. All
honest things do not carry their reasons in their hands in such
fashion. It is indecent to show all the five fingers at the same time.
That which can be "demonstrated" is little worth. The instinct of
every party-speaker tells him that dialectics excites mistrust and
carries little conviction. Nothing is more easily wiped away than the
effect of a dialectician. It can only be a <i>last defence.</i> One must
be in an extremity; it is necessary to have to <i>extort</i> one's rights;
otherwise one makes no use of dialectics. That is why the Jews were
dialecticians, Reynard the Fox was a dialectician, and so was Socrates.
As a dialectician a person has a merciless instrument in his hand:
he can play the tyrant with it; he compromises when he conquers. The
dialectician leaves it to his opponent to demonstrate that he is not an
idiot; he is made furious <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>and helpless, while the dialectician himself
remains calm and still possessed of his triumphant reasoning powers&mdash;he
<i>paralyses</i> his opponent's intellect.&mdash;The dialectician's irony is a
form of mob-revenge: the ferocity of the oppressed lies in the cold
knife-cuts of the syllogism....</p>

<p>In Plato, as in all men of excessive sensuality and wild fancies, the
charm of concepts was so great, that he involuntarily honoured and
deified the concept as a form of ideal. <i>Dialectical intoxication</i>: as
the consciousness of being able to exercise control over one's self by
means of it&mdash;as an instrument of the Will to Power.</p>


<p class="parnum">432.</p>

<p><i>The problem of Socrates.</i>&mdash;The two antitheses: the <i>tragic</i> and the
<i>Socratic</i> spirits&mdash;measured according to the law of Life.</p>

<p>To what extent is the Socratic spirit a decadent phenomenon? to what
extent are robust health and power still revealed by the whole attitude
of the scientific man, his dialectics, his ability, and his severity?
(the health of the <i>plebeian</i>; whose malice, <i>esprit frondeur,</i>
whose astuteness, whose rascally depths, are held in check by his
<i>cleverness</i>; the whole type is "ugly").</p>

<p><i>Uglification</i>: self-derision, dialectical dryness, intelligence in
the form of a <i>tyrant</i> against the "tyrant" (instinct). Everything in
Socrates is exaggeration, eccentricity, caricature; he is a buffoon
with the blood of Voltaire in his veins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
He discovers a new form of <i>agon</i>; he is the first fencing-master in
the superior classed of Athens; he stands for nothing else than the
<i>highest form of cleverness</i>: he calls it "virtue" (he regarded it as a
means of <i>salvation</i>; he did not choose to be <i>clever,</i> cleverness was
<i>de rigueur</i>); the proper thing is to control one's self in suchwise
that one enters into a struggle <i>not</i> with passions but with reasons
as one's weapons (Spinoza's stratagem&mdash;the unravelment of the errors
of passion);&mdash;it is desirable to discover how every one may be caught
once he is goaded into a passion, and to know how illogically passion
proceeds; self-mockery is practised in order to injure the very roots
of the <i>feelings of resentment.</i></p>

<p>It is my wish to understand which idiosyncratic states form a part of
the Socratic problem: its association of reason, virtue, and happiness.
With this absurd doctrine of the identity of these things it succeeded
<i>in charming</i> the world: ancient philosophy could not rid itself of
this doctrine....</p>

<p>Absolute lack of objective interest: hatred of science: the
idiosyncrasy of considering one's self a problem. Acoustic
hallucinations in Socrates: morbid element. When the intellect is
rich and independent, it most strongly resists preoccupying itself
with morality. How is it that Socrates is a <i>moral-maniac</i>?&mdash;Every
"practical" philosophy immediately steps into the foreground in times
of distress. When morality and religion become the chief interests of a
community, they are signs of a state of distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">433.</p>

<p>Intelligence, clearness, hardness, and logic as weapons against the<i>
wildness of the instincts</i>. The latter must be dangerous and must
threaten ruin, otherwise no purpose can be served by developing
<i>intelligence</i> to this degree of tyranny. In order to make a <i>tyrant</i>
of intelligence the instincts must first have proved themselves
tyrants. This is the problem. It was a very timely one in those days.
Reason became virtue&mdash;virtue equalled happiness.</p>

<p><i>Solution</i>: Greek philosophers stand upon the same fundamental fact
of their inner experiences as Socrates does; five feet from excess,
from anarchy and from dissolution&mdash;all decadent men. They regard him
as a doctor: Logic as will to power, as will to control self, as will
to "happiness." The wildness and anarchy of Socrates' instincts is a
<i>sign of decadence</i>, as is also the superfœtation of logic and clear
reasoning in him. Both are abnormities, each belongs to the other.
Criticism. Decadence reveals itself in this concern about "happiness"
(<i>i.e.</i> about the "salvation of the soul"; <i>i.e. to feel that one's
condition is a danger</i>). Its fanatical interest in "happiness" shows
the pathological condition of the subconscious self: it was a vital
interest. The <i>alternative</i> which faced them all was: to be reasonable
or to perish. The morality of Greek philosophers shows that they felt
they were in danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">434.</p>

<p><i>Why everything resolved itself into mummery.&mdash;</i>Rudimentary
psychology, which only considered the <i>conscious</i> lapses of men (as
causes), which regarded "consciousness" as an attribute of the soul,
and which sought a will behind every action (<i>i.e.</i> an intention),
could only answer "<i>Happiness</i>" to the question: "<i>What does man
desire?</i>" (it was impossible to answer "Power," because that would have
been <i>immoral)</i>;&mdash;consequently behind all men's actions there is the
intention of attaining to happiness by means of them. Secondly: if man
as a matter of fact does not attain to happiness, why is it? Because he
mistakes the means thereto.&mdash;<i>What is the unfailing means of acquiring
happiness?</i> Answer: <i>virtue.</i>&mdash;Why virtue? Because virtue is supreme
rationalness, and rationalness makes mistakes in the choice of means
impossible: virtue in the form of <i>reason</i> is the way to happiness.
Dialectics is the constant occupation of virtue, because it does away
with passion and intellectual cloudiness.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, man does <i>not</i> desire "happiness." Pleasure is
a sensation of power: if the passions are excluded, those states of
the mind are also excluded which afford the greatest sensation of
power and therefore of pleasure. The highest rationalism is a state of
cool clearness, which is very far from being able to bring about that
feeling of power which every kind of <i>exaltation</i> involves....</p>

<p>The ancient philosophers combat everything <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>that intoxicates and
exalts&mdash;everything that impairs the perfect coolness and impartiality
of the mind.... They were consistent with their first false principle:
that consciousness was the <i>highest,</i> the <i>supreme</i> state of mind, the
prerequisite of perfection&mdash;whereas the reverse is true....</p>

<p>Any kind of action is imperfect in proportion as it has been willed or
conscious. The philosophers of antiquity <i>were the greatest duffers</i>
in practice, "because they condemned themselves" theoretically
to <i>dufferdom,</i>.... In practice everything resolved itself into
theatricalness: and he who saw through it, as Pyrrho did, for instance,
thought as everybody did&mdash;that is to say, that in goodness and
uprightness "paltry people" were far superior to philosophers.</p>

<p>All the deeper natures of antiquity were disgusted at the <i>philosophers
of virtue</i>; all people saw in them was brawlers and actors. (This was
the judgment passed on <i>Plato</i> by <i>Epicurus</i> and <i>Pyrrho</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Result</i>: In practical life, in patience, goodness, and mutual
assistance, paltry people were above them:&mdash;this is something like the
judgment Dostoiewsky or Tolstoy claims for his muzhiks: they are more
philosophical in practice, they are more courageous in their way of
dealing with the exigencies of life....</p>


<p class="parnum">435.</p>

<p><i>A criticism of the philosopher.</i>&mdash;Philosophers and moralists merely
deceive themselves when they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>imagine that they escape from decadence
by <i>opposing</i> it. That lies beyond their wills: and however little they
may be aware of the fact, it is generally discovered, subsequently that
they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence.</p>

<p>Let us examine the philosophers of Greece&mdash;Plato, for instance. He
it was who separated the instincts from the polis, from the love of
contest, from military efficiency, from art, beauty, the mysteries,
and the belief in tradition and in ancestors.... He was the seducer of
the nobles: he himself seduces through the <i>roturier</i> Socrates.... He
denied all the first principles of the "noble Greek" of sterling worth;
he made dialectics an everyday practice, conspired with the tyrants,
dabbled in politics for the future, and was the example of a man whose
<i>instincts</i> were the example of a man whose <i>instincts</i> were most
perfectly separated from <i>tradition.</i> He is profound and passionate in
everything that is <i>anti-Hellenic</i>....</p>

<p>One after the other, these great philosophers represent the <i>typical</i>
forms of decadence: the moral and religious idiosyncrasy, anarchy,
nihilism, (ἀδιαφορία), cynicism, hardening principles, hedonism, and
reaction.</p>

<p>The question of "happiness," of "virtue," and of the "salvation of the
soul," is the expression of <i>physiological contradictoriness</i> in these
declining natures: their instincts lack all <i>balance</i> and <i>purpose.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">436.</p>

<p>To what extent do dialectics and the faith in reason rest upon <i>moral</i>
prejudices? With Plato we are as the temporary inhabitants of an
intelligible world of goodness, still in possession of a bequest from
former times: divine dialectics taking its root in goodness leads to
everything good (it follows, therefore, that it must lead "backwards").
Even Descartes had a notion of the fact that, according to a thoroughly
Christian and moral attitude of mind, which includes a belief in a
<i>good</i> God as the Creator of all things, the truthfulness of God
<i>guarantees</i> the judgments of our senses for us. But for this religious
sanction and warrant of our senses and our reason, whence should
we obtain our right to trust in existence? That thinking must be a
measure of reality,&mdash;that what cannot be the subject of thought, cannot
<i>exist,</i>&mdash;is a coarse <i>non plus ultra</i> of a moral blind confidence
(in the essential principle of truth at the root of all things); this
in itself is a mad assumption which our experience contradicts every
minute. We cannot think of anything precisely as it is....</p>


<p class="parnum">437.</p>

<p>The real <i>philosophers of Greece</i> are those which came before Socrates
(with Socrates something changes). They are all distinguished men,
they take their stand away from the people and from usage; they have
travelled; they are earnest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>to the point of sombreness, their eyes
are calm, and they are not unacquainted with the business of state and
diplomacy. They anticipated all the great concepts which coming sages
were to have concerning things in general: they themselves represented
these concepts, they made systems out of themselves. Nothing run give a
higher idea of Greek intellect than this sudden fruitfulness in types,
than this involuntary completeness in the drawing up of all the great
possibilities of the philosophical ideal. I can see only one original
figure in those that came afterwards: a late arrival but necessarily
the last&mdash;<i>Pyrrho</i> the nihilist. His instincts were opposed to the
influences which had become ascendant in the mean-time the Socratic
school, Plato, and the artistic optimism of Heraclitus. (Pyrrho goes
back to Democritus <i>via</i> Protagoras....)</p>

<p class="center">***</p>

<p>Wise weariness: Pyrrho. To live humbly among the humble. Devoid of
pride. To live in the vulgar way; to honour and believe what every
one believes. To be on one's guard against science and intellect, and
against everything that <i>puffs one out.</i> ... To be simply patient
in the extreme, careless and mild;&mdash;<i>ὰπάθεια</i> or, better still,
πραῢτης. A Buddhist for Greece, bred amid the tumult of the
Schools; born alter his time; weary; an example of the protest of
weariness against the eagerness of dialecticians; the incredulity of
the tired man in regard <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 3611]</a></span>to the importance of everything. He had seen
<i>Alexander</i>; he had seen the <i>Indian penitents.</i> To such late-arrivals
and creatures of great subtlety, everything lowly, poor, and idiotic,
is seductive. It narcoticises: it gives them relaxation (Pascal).
On the other hand, they mix with the crowd, and get confounded
with the rest. These weary creatures need warmth.... To overcome
contradiction; to do away with contests; to have no will to excel in
any way; to deny the <i>Greek</i> instincts (Pyrrho lived with his sister,
who was a midwife.) To rig out wisdom in such a way that it no longer
distinguishes; to give it the ragged mantle of poverty; to perform
the lowest offices, and to go to market and sell sucking-pigs....
Sweetness, clearness, indifference; no need of virtues that require
attitudes; to be equal to all even in virtue: final conquest of one's
self, final indifference.</p>

<p>Pyrrho and Epicurus;&mdash;two forms of Greek decadence; they are related
in their hatred of dialectics and all <i>theatrical</i> virtues. These
two things together were then called philosophy; Pyrrho and Epicurus
intentionally held that which they loved in low esteem; they chose
common and even contemptible names for it, and they represented a state
in which one is neither ill, healthy, lively, nor dead.... Epicurus was
more <i>naïf,</i> more idyllic, more grateful; Pyrrho had more experience of
the world, had travelled more, and was more nihilistic. His life was a
protest against the great <i>doctrine of Identity</i> (Happiness = Virtue =
Knowledge). The proper way of living is not promoted by science: wisdom
does not make <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>"wise." ... The proper way of living does not desire
happiness, it turns away from happiness....</p>


<p class="parnum">438.</p>

<p>The war against the "old faith," as Epicurus waged it, was, strictly
speaking, a struggle against <i>pre-existing</i> Christianity&mdash;the struggle
against a world then already gloomy, moralised, acidified throughout
with feelings of guilt, and grown old and sick.</p>

<p>Not the "moral corruption" of antiquity, but precisely its <i>moral
infectedness</i> was the prerequisite which enabled Christianity to become
its master. Moral fanaticism (in short: Plato) destroyed paganism by
transvaluing its values and poisoning its innocence. We ought at last
to understand that what was then destroyed was <i>higher</i> than what
prevailed! Christianity grew on the soil of psychological corruption,
and could only take root in rotten ground.</p>


<p class="parnum">439.</p>

<p>Science: as a disciplinary measure or as an instinct&mdash;I see a decline
of the instincts in Greek philosophers: otherwise they could not have
been guilty of the profound error of regarding the conscious state
as the more valuable state. The intensity of consciousness stands in
the inverse ratio to the ease and speed of cerebral transmission.
Greek philosophy upheld the opposite view, which is always the sign of
weakened instincts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
We must, in sooth, seek <i>perfect life</i> there where it is least
conscious (that is to say, there where it is least aware of its logic,
its reasons, its means, its intentions, and its <i>utility).</i> The return
to the facts of <i>common sense,</i> the facts of the common man and of
"paltry people." <i>Honesty and intelligence</i> stored up for generations
of people who are quite unconscious of their principles, and who
even have some fear of principles. It is not reasonable to desire a
<i>reasoning virtue.</i> ... A philosopher is compromised by such a desire.</p>


<p class="parnum">440.</p>

<p>When morality&mdash;that is to say, refinement, prudence, bravery, and
equity&mdash;have been stored up in the same way, thanks to the moral
efforts of a whole succession of generations, the collective power of
this hoard of virtue projects its rays even into that sphere where
honesty is most seldom present&mdash;the sphere of <i>intellect.</i> When a
thing becomes conscious, it is the sign of a state of ill-ease in
the organism; something new has got to be found, the organism is not
satisfied or adapted, it is subject to distress, suspense, and it is
hypersensitive&mdash;precisely all this is consciousness....</p>

<p>Gennius lies in the instincts; goodness does too. One only acts
perfectly when one acts instinctively. Even from the moral point of
view all thinking which is conscious is merely a process of groping,
and in the majority of cases an attack on morality. Scientific honesty
is always sacrificed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>when a thinker begins to reason: let any one try
the experiment: put the wisest man in the balance, and then let him
discourse upon morality....</p>

<p>It could also be proved that the whole of a man's <i>conscious</i> thinking
shows a much lower standard of morality than the thoughts of the same
man would show if they were led by his <i>instincts.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">441.</p>

<p>The struggle against Socrates, Plato, and all the Socratic schools,
proceeds from the profound instinct that man <i>is</i> not made <i>better</i>
when he is shown that virtue may be demonstrated or based upon
reason.... This in the end is the niggardly fact, it was the agonal
instinct in all these born dialecticians, which drove them to glorify
their <i>personal abilities</i> as the <i>highest of all qualities,</i> and to
represent every other form of goodness as conditioned by them. The
<i>anti-scientific</i> spirit of all this "philosophy": it <i>will never admit
that it is not right.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">442.</p>

<p>This is extraordinary. From its very earliest beginnings, Greek
philosophy carries on a struggle against science with the weapons of
a theory of knowledge, especially of scepticism; and why is this? It
is always in favour of <i>morality....</i> (Physicists and medical men
are hated.) Socrates, Aristippus, the Megarian school, the Cynics,
Epicurus and Pyrrho&mdash;a general onslaught upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>knowledge in favour
of <i>morality....</i> (Hatred of dialectics also.) There is still a
problem to be solved: they approach sophistry in order to be rid of
science. On the other hand, the physicists are subjected to such an
extent that, among their first principles, they include the theory of
truth and of real being: for instance, the atom, the four elements
(<i>juxtaposition</i> of being, in order to explain its multiformity and its
transformations). Contempt of <i>objectivity</i> in interests is taught:
return to practical interest, and to the personal utility of all
knowledge....</p>

<p>The struggle against science is directed at: (1) its pathos
(objectivity); (2) its means (that is to say, at its utility); (3) its
results (which are considered childish). It is the same struggle which
is taken up later on by the <i>Church</i> in the name of piety: the Church
inherited the whole arsenal of antiquity for her war with science. The
theory of knowledge played the same part in the affair as it did in
Kant's or the Indians' case. There is no desire whatever to be troubled
with it, a free hand is wanted for the "purpose" that is envisaged.</p>

<p>Against what powers are they actually defending themselves? Against
dutifulness, against obedience to law, against the compulsion of going
hand in hand&mdash;I believe this is what is called <i>Freedom....</i></p>

<p>This is how decadence manifests itself: the instinct of solidarity is
so degenerate that solidarity itself gets to be regarded as <i>tyranny</i>:
no authority or solidarity is brooked, nobody any longer <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>desires to
fall in with the rank and file, and to adopt its ignobly slow pace. The
slow movement which is the tempo of science is generally hated, as are
also the scientific man's indifference in regard to getting on, his
long breath, and his impersonal attitude.</p>


<p class="parnum">443.</p>

<p>At bottom, morality is <i>hostile</i> to science: Socrates was so already
too&mdash;and the reason is, that science considers certain things important
which have no relation whatsoever to "good" and "evil," and which
therefore reduce the gravity of our feelings concerning "good" and
"evil." What morality requires is that the whole of a man should serve
it with all his power: it considers it waste on the part of a creature
that <i>can ill afford waste,</i> when a man earnestly troubles his head
about stars or plants. That is why science very quickly declined
in Greece, once Socrates had inoculated scientific work with the
disease of morality. The mental attitudes reached by a Democritus, a
Hippocrates, and a Thucydides, have not been reached a second time.&mdash;</p>


<p class="parnum">444.</p>

<p>The problem of the <i>philosopher</i> and of the <i>scientific</i> man.&mdash;The
influence of age; depressing habits (sedentary study <i>à la</i> Kant;
over-work; inadequate nourishment of the brain; reading). A more
essential question still: is it not already perhaps a <i>symptom</i> of
decadence when thinking tends to establish <i>generalities</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
<i>Objectivity regarded as the disintegration of the will</i> (to be able
to remain as detached as possible ...). This presupposes a tremendous
adiaphora in regard to the strong passions: a kind of isolation, an
exceptional position, opposition to the normal passions.</p>

<p>Type: desertion of <i>home-country</i> emigrants go ever greater distances
afield; growing exoticism; the voice of the old imperative dies
away;&mdash;and the continual question "whither?" ("happiness") is a sign
of <i>emancipation</i> from forms of organisation, a sign of breaking loose
from everything.</p>

<p>Problem: is the man of <i>science</i> more of a decadent symptom than the
philosopher?&mdash;as a <i>whole</i> scientific man is not, cut loose from
everything, only a part of his being is consecrated exclusively to the
service of knowledge and disciplined to maintain a special attitude and
point of view; in his department he is in need of <i>all</i> the virtues
of a strong race, of robust health, of great severity, manliness and
intelligence. He is rather a symptom of the great multiformity of
culture than of the effeteness of the latter. The decadent scholar
is a <i>bad</i> scholar. Whereas the decadent philosopher has always been
reckoned hitherto as the typical philosopher.</p>


<p class="parnum">445.</p>

<p>Among philosophers, nothing is more rare than <i>intellectual
uprightness</i>: they perhaps say the very reverse, and even believe it.
But the prerequisite of all their work is, that they can only admit
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>certain truths; they know what they <i>have</i> to prove; and the fact
that they must be agreed as to these "truths" is almost what makes them
recognise one another as philosophers. There are, for instance, the
truths of morality. But belief in morality is not a proof of morality:
there are cases&mdash;and the philosopher's case is one in point&mdash;when a
belief of this sort is simply a piece of <i>immorality</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">446.</p>

<p><i>What is the retrograde factor in a philosopher?</i>&mdash;He teaches that
the qualities which he happens to possess are the only qualities that
exist, that they are indispensable to those who wish to attain to the
"highest good" (for instance, dialectics with Plato). He would have
all men raise themselves, <i>gradatim,</i> to <i>his</i> type as the highest. He
despises what is generally esteemed&mdash;by him a gulf is cleft between
the highest <i>priestly</i> values and the values of the <i>world.</i> He knows
what is true, who God is, what every one's goal should be, and the way
thereto.... The typical philosopher is thus an absolute dogmatist;&mdash;if
he <i>requires</i> scepticism at all it is only in order to be able to speak
dogmatically of his <i>principal purpose</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">447.</p>

<p>When the philosopher is confronted with his rival&mdash;science, for
instance, he becomes a sceptic; then he appropriates a <i>form of
knowledge</i> which he denies to the man of science; he goes hand in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
hand with the priest so that he may not be suspected of atheism or
materialism; he considers an attack made upon himself as an attack
upon morals, religion, virtue, and order&mdash;he knows how to bring his
opponents into ill repute by calling them "seducers" and "underminers":
then he marches shoulder to shoulder with power.</p>

<p>The philosopher at war with other philosophers:&mdash;he does his best
to compel them to appear like anarchists, disbelievers, opponents of
authority. In short, when he fights, he fights exactly like a priest
and like the priesthood.</p>

<p class="title">3. The Truths and Errors of Philosophers.</p>


<p class="parnum">448.</p>

<p>Philosophy defined by Kant: "<i>The science of the limitations of
reason</i>"!!</p>


<p class="parnum">449.</p>

<p>According to Aristotle, Philosophy is the art of discovering truth. On
the other hand, the Epicurians, who availed themselves of Aristotle's
<i>sensual</i> theory of knowledge, retorted in ironical opposition to the
search for truth: "Philosophy is the art of <i>Life.</i>"</p>


<p class="parnum">450.</p>

<p><i>The three great naïvetés:&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Knowledge as a means of happiness (as if ...);</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>
<p>Knowledge as a means to virtue (as if ...);</p>

<p>Knowledge as a means to the "denial of Life"&mdash;inasmuch as it leads to
disappointment&mdash;(as if ...).</p>


<p class="parnum">451.</p>

<p>As if there were a "truth" which one could by some means approach!</p>


<p class="parnum">452.</p>

<p>Error and ignorance are fatal.&mdash;The assumption that <i>truth has been
found</i> and that ignorance and error are at an end, constitutes one
of the most seductive thoughts in the world. Granted that it be
generally accepted, it paralyses the will to test, to investigate,
to be cautious, and to gather experience: it may even be regarded as
criminal&mdash;that is to say, as a <i>doubt</i> concerning truth....</p>

<p>"Truth" is therefore more fatal than error and ignorance, because it
paralyses the forces which lead to enlightenment and knowledge. The
passion for <i>idleness</i> now stands up for "truth" ("Thought is pain
and misery!"), as also do order, rule, the joy of possession, the
pride of wisdom&mdash;in fact, <i>vanity.</i>&mdash;it is easier to <i>obey</i> than to
<i>examine</i>; it is more gratifying to think "I possess the truth," than
to see only darkness in all directions; ... but, above all, it is
reassuring, it lends confidence, and alleviates life&mdash;it "improves"
the character inasmuch as it <i>reduces mistrust.</i>" Spiritual peace," "a
quiet conscience"&mdash;these things <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>are inventions which are only possible
provided "<i>Truth be found.</i>"&mdash;"By their fruits ye shall know them." ...
"Truth" is the truth because it makes men <i>better....</i> The process goes
on: all goodness and all success is placed to the credit of "truth."</p>

<p>This is the <i>proof by success</i>: the happiness, contentment, and the
welfare of a community or of an individual, are now understood to be
the <i>result of the belief in morality</i>.... Conversely: <i>failure</i> is
ascribed to a <i>lack</i> of faith.</p>


<p class="parnum">453.</p>

<p>The causes of error lie just as much in the <i>good</i> as in the <i>bad will</i>
of man:&mdash;in an incalculable number of cases he conceals reality from
himself, he falsifies it, so that he may not suffer from his good or
bad will. God, for instance, is considered the shaper of man's destiny;
he interprets his little lot as though everything were intentionally
sent to him for the salvation of his soul,&mdash;this act of ignorance in
"philology," which to a more subtle intellect would seem unclean and
false, is done, in the majority of cases, with perfect <i>good faith.</i>
Goodwill, "noble feelings," and "lofty states of the soul" are just as
underhand and deceptive in the means they use as are the passions love,
hatred, and revenge, which morality has repudiated and declared to be
egotistic.</p>

<p>Errors are what mankind has had to pay for most dearly: and taking them
all in all, the errors which have resulted from goodwill are those
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>have wrought the most harm. The illusion which makes people
happy is more harmful than the illusion which is immediately followed
by evil results: the latter increases keenness and mistrust, and
purifies, the understanding; the former merely narcoticises....</p>

<p>Fine feelings and noble impulses ought, speaking physiologically, to be
classified with the narcotics: their abuse is followed by precisely the
same results as the abuse of any other opiate&mdash;<i>weak nerves</i>.</p>


<p class="parnum">454.</p>

<p>Error is the most expensive luxury that man can indulge in: and if the
error happen to be a physiological one, it is fatal to life. What has
mankind paid for most dearly hitherto? For its "truths ": for every one
of these were errors <i>in physiologicis></i>....</p>


<p class="parnum">455.</p>

<p>Psychological <i>confusions</i>: the <i>desire for belief</i> is confounded with
the "will to truth" (for instance, in Carlyle). But the <i>desire for
disbelief</i> has also been confounded with the "will to truth" (a need of
ridding one's self of a belief for a hundred reasons: in order to carry
one's point against certain "believers"). <i>What is it that inspires
Sceptics?</i> The hatred of dogmatists&mdash;or a need of repose, weariness as
in Pyrrho's case.</p>

<p>The <i>advantages</i> which were expected to come from truth, were the
advantages resulting from a belief in <i>it</i>: for, in itself, truth could
have been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>thoroughly painful, harmful, and even fatal. Likewise truth
was combated only on account of the advantages which a victory over it
would provide&mdash;for instance, emancipation from the yoke of the ruling
powers.</p>

<p>The method of truth was <i>not</i> based upon motives of truthfulness, but
upon <i>motives of power, upon the desire to be superior.</i></p>

<p><i>How is</i> truth <i>proved</i>? By means of the feeling of increased
power,&mdash;by means of utility,&mdash;by means of indispensability,&mdash;<i>in short,
by means of its advantages</i> (that is to say, hypotheses concerning what
truth should be like in order that it may be embraced by us). But this
involves <i>prejudice</i>: it is a sign that <i>truth</i> does not enter the
question at all....</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the "will to truth," for instance in the
Goncourts? and in the <i>naturalists</i>?&mdash;A criticism of "objectivity."</p>

<p>Why should we know: why should we not prefer to be deceived?...
But what was needed was always belief&mdash;and <i>not</i> truth.... Belief
is created by means which are quite <i>opposed</i> to the method of
investigation: <i>it even depends upon the exclusion of the latter.</i></p>


<p class="parnum">456.</p>

<p>A certain degree of faith suffices to-day to give us an <i>objection</i>
to what is believed&mdash;it does more, it makes us question the spiritual
healthiness of the believer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">457.</p>

<p><i>Martyrs.</i>&mdash;To combat anything that is based upon reverence, opponents
must be possessed of both daring and recklessness, and be hindered
by no scruples.... Now, if one considers that for thousands of
years man has sanctified as truths only those things which were in
reality errors, and that he has branded any criticism of them with
the hall-mark of badness, one will have to acknowledge, however
reluctantly, that a goodly amount of <i>immoral deeds</i> were necessary in
order to give the initiative to an attack&mdash;I mean to <i>reason....</i> That
these immoralists have always posed as the "martyrs of truth" should
be forgiven them: the truth of the matter is that they did not stand
up and deny owing to an instinct for truth; but because of a love of
dissolution, criminal scepticism, and the love of adventure. In other
cases it is personal rancour which drives them into the province of
problems&mdash;they only combat certain points of view in order to be
able to carry their point against certain people. But, above all, it
is revenge which has become scientifically useful&mdash;the revenge of the
oppressed, those who, thanks to the truth that happens to be ruling,
have been pressed aside and even smothered....</p>

<p>Truth, that is to say the scientific method, was grasped and favoured
by such as recognised that it was a useful weapon of war&mdash;an instrument
of <i>destruction</i>....</p>

<p>In order to be honoured as opponents, they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>were moreover obliged
to use an apparatus similar to that used by those whom they were
attacking: they therefore brandished the concept "truth" as absolutely
as their adversaries did&mdash;they became fanatics at least in their
poses, because no other pose could be expected to be taken seriously.
What still remained to be done was left to persecution, to passion,
and the uncertainty of the persecuted&mdash;hatred waxed great, and the
first impulse began to die away and to leave the field entirely to
science. Ultimately all of them wanted to be right in the same absurd
way as their opponents.... The word "conviction," "faith," the pride
of martyrdom&mdash;these things are most unfavourable to knowledge. The
adversaries of truth finally adopt the whole subjective manner of
deciding about truth,&mdash;that is to say, by means of poses, sacrifices,
and heroic resolutions,&mdash;and thus <i>prolong</i> the <i>dominion</i> of the
anti-scientific method. As martyrs they compromise their very own deed.</p>


<p class="parnum">458.</p>

<p><i>The dangerous distinction between "theoretical" and "practical"</i> in
Kant for instance, but also in the ancient philosophers:&mdash;they behave
as if pure intellectuality presented them with the problems of science
and metaphysics;&mdash;they behave as if practice should be judged by a
measure of its own, whatever the judgment of theory may be.</p>

<p>Against the first tendency I set up my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span><i>psychology of philosophers</i>:
their strangest calculations and "intellectuality" are still but the
last pallid impress of a physiological fact; spontaneity is absolutely
lacking in them, everything is instinct, everything is intended to
follow a certain direction from the first....</p>

<p>Against the second tendency I put my question: whether we know another
method of acting correctly, besides that of thinking correctly;
the last case <i>is</i> action, the first presupposes thought Are we
possessed of a means whereby we can judge of the value of a method
of life differently from the value of a theory: through induction or
comparison?... Guileless people imagine that in this respect we are
better equipped, we know what is "good"&mdash;and the philosophers are
content to repeat this view. We conclude that some sort of <i>faith</i> is
at work in this matter, and nothing more....</p>

<p>"Men must act; <i>consequently</i> rules of conduct are necessary"&mdash;this is
what even the ancient Sceptics thought. The <i>urgent need</i> of a definite
decision in this department of knowledge is used as an argument in
favour of regarding something as <i>true</i>!...</p>

<p>"Men must not act"&mdash;said their more consistent brothers, the Buddhists,
and then thought out a mode of conduct which would deliver man from the
yoke of action....</p>

<p>To adapt one's self, to live as the "<i>common man</i>" lives, and to regard
as right and proper what <i>he</i> regards as right: this is <i>submission</i> to
the <i>gregarious instinct.</i> One must carry one's courage <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>and severity
so far as to learn to consider such submission a <i>disgrace.</i> One should
not live according to two standards!... One should not separate theory
and practice!...</p>


<p class="parnum">459.</p>

<p>Of all that which was formerly held to be true, not one word is to be
credited. Everything which was formerly disdained as unholy, forbidden,
contemptible, and fatal&mdash;all these flowers now bloom on the most
charming paths of truth.</p>

<p>The whole of this old morality concerns us no longer: it contains not
one idea which is still worthy of respect. We have outlived it&mdash;we
are no longer sufficiently coarse and guileless to be forced to allow
ourselves to be lied to in this way.... In more polite language: we are
too virtuous for it.... And if truth in the old sense were "true" only
because the old morality said "yea" to it, and <i>had a right</i> to say
"yea" to it: it follows that no truth of the past can any longer be of
use to us.... Our <i>criterion</i> of truth is /certainly not morality: we
<i>refute</i> an assertion when we show that it is dependent upon morality
and is inspired by noble feelings.</p>


<p class="parnum">460.</p>

<p>All these values are empirical and conditioned. But he who believes
in them and who honours them, <i>refuses</i> to acknowledge this aspect of
them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>All philosophers believe in these values, and one form their
reverence takes is the endeavour to make <i>a priori truths</i> out of them.
The falsifying nature of <i>reverence</i>....</p>

<p>Reverence is the supreme test of intellectual <i>honesty,</i> but in the
whole history of philosophy there is no such thing as intellectual
honesty,&mdash;but the "love of goodness ..."</p>

<p>On the one hand, there is an absolute <i>lack of method</i> in testing the
value of these values; <i>secondly,</i> there is a general disinclination
either to test them or to regard them as conditioned at all.&mdash;All
<i>anti-scientific</i> instincts assembled round moral values in order to
<i>keep science out</i> of this department....</p>


<hr />
<p class="title">4. Concluding Remarks in the Criticism of Philosophy.</p>


<p class="parnum">461.</p>


<p><i>Why philosophers are slanderers.</i>&mdash;The artful and blind hostility
of philosophers towards the <i>senses</i>&mdash;what an amount of <i>mob</i> and
<i>middle-class</i> qualities lie in all this hatred!</p>

<p>The crowd always believes that an abuse of which it feels the harmful
results, constitutes an <i>objection</i> to the thing which happens to be
abused: all insurrectionary movements against principles, whether in
politics or agriculture, always follow a line of argument suggested by
this ulterior motive: the abuse must be shown to be necessary to, and,
inherent in, the principle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
It is a <i>woeful</i> history: mankind looks for a principle, from the
standpoint of which he will be able to contemn man&mdash;he invents a world
in order to be able to slander and throw mud at this world: as a matter
of fact, he snatches every time at nothing, and construes this nothing
as "God," as "Truth," and, in any case, as judge and detractor of
<i>this</i> existence....</p>

<p>If one should require a proof of how deeply and thoroughly the actually
<i>barbarous</i> needs of man, even in his present state of tameness and
"civilisation," still seek gratification, one should contemplate the
"leitmotifs" of the whole of the evolution of philosophy:&mdash;a sort
of revenge upon reality, a surreptitious process of destroying the
values by means of which men live, a <i>dissatisfied</i> soul to which
the conditions of discipline is one of torture, and which takes a
particular pleasure in morbidly severing all the bonds that bind it to
such a condition.</p>

<p>The history of philosophy is the story of a <i>secret and mad hatred</i>
of the prerequisities of Life, of the feelings which make for the
real values of Life, and of all partisanship in favour of Life.
Philosophers have never hesitated to affirm a fanciful world, provided
it contradicted this world, and furnished them with a weapon wherewith
they could calumniate this world. Up to the present, philosophy has
been the <i>grand school of slander</i>: and its power has been so great,
that even to-day our science, which pretends to be the advocate of
Life, has <i>accepted</i> the fundamental position of slander, and treats
this world as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>"appearance," and this chain of causes as though it were
only phenomenal. What is the hatred which is active here?</p>

<p>I fear that it is still the <i>Circe of philosophers&mdash;</i>Morality, which
plays them the trick of compelling them to be ever slanderers.... They
believed in moral "truths," in these they thought they had found the
highest values; what alternative had they left, save that of denying
existence ever more emphatically the more they got to know about it?...
For this life is <i>immoral....</i> And it is based upon immoral first
principles: and morality says <i>nay</i> to Life.</p>

<p>Let us suppress the real world: and in order to do this, we must first
suppress the highest values current hitherto&mdash;morals.... It is enough
to show that morality itself <i>is immoral,</i> in the same sense as that in
which immorality has been condemned heretofore. If an end be thus made
to the tyranny of the former values, if we have suppressed the "real
world," a <i>new order of values</i> must follow of its own accord.</p>

<p>The world of appearance and the world <i>of lies</i>: this constitutes the
contradiction. The latter hitherto has been the "real world," "truth,"
"God." This is the one which we still have to suppress.</p>

<p>The <i>logic of my conception</i>:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Morality as the highest value</i> (it is master of <i>all</i> the phases
of philosophy, even of the Sceptics). <i>Result</i>: this world is no good,
it is not the "real world."</p>

<p>(2) <i>What</i> is it that determines the highest value here? What, in
sooth, is morality?&mdash;It is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>the instinct of <i>decadence</i>; it is the
means whereby the exhausted and the degenerate <i>revenge themselves.</i>
<i>Historical</i> proof: philosophers have always been decadents ... in the
service of <i>nihilistic</i> religions.</p>

<p>(3) It is the instinct of decadence coming to the fore as <i>will to
power.</i> Proof: the absolute <i>immorality</i> of the means employed by
morality throughout its history.</p>

<p>General aspect: the values which have been highest hitherto constitute
a specific case of the will to power; morality itself is a specific
case of immorality.</p>


<p class="parnum">462.</p>

<p><i>The principal innovations</i>: Instead of "moral values," nothing but
<i>naturalistic values.</i> Naturalisation of morality.</p>

<p>In the place of "sociology," a <i>doctrine of the forms of dominion.</i></p>

<p>In the place of "society," the <i>complex whole of culture,</i> which is
<i>my</i> chief interest (whether in its entirety or in parts).</p>

<p>In the place of the "theory of knowledge," a <i>doctrine which laid down
the value of the passions</i> (to this a hierarchy of the passions would
belong: the passions <i>transfigured</i>; their <i>superior rank,</i> their
"<i>spirituality</i>").</p>

<p>In the place of "metaphysics" and religion, the doctrine of <i>Eternal
Recurrence</i> (this being regarded as a means to the breeding and
selection of men).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>
<p class="parnum">463.</p>

<p>My precursors: Schopenhauer. To what extent I deepened pessimism, and
first brought its full meaning within my grasp, by means of its most
extreme opposite.</p>

<p>Likewise: the higher Europeans, the pioneers of <i>great politics.</i></p>

<p>Likewise: the Greeks and their genesis.</p>


<p class="parnum">464.</p>

<p>I have named those who were unconsciously my workers and precursors.
But in what direction may I turn with any hope of finding my particular
kind of philosophers themselves, or at least <i>my yearning for new
philosophers</i>? In that direction, alone, where a <i>noble</i> attitude of
mind prevails, an attitude of mind which believes in slavery and in
manifold orders of rank, as the prerequisites of any high degree of
culture. In that direction, alone, where a <i>creative</i> attitude of
mind prevails, an attitude of mind which does not regard the world
of happiness and repose, the "Sabbath of Sabbaths" as an end to be
desired, and which, even in peace, honours the means which lead to new
wars; an attitude of mind which would prescribe laws for the future,
which for the sake of the future would treat everything that exists
to-day with harshness and even tyranny; a daring and "immoral" attitude
of mind, which would wish to see both the good and the evil qualities
in man developed to their fullest extent, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>because it would feel itself
able to put each in its right place&mdash;that is to say, in that place in
which each would need the other. But what prospect has he of finding
what he seeks, who goes in search of philosophers to-day? Is it not
probable that, even with the best Diogenes-lantern in his hand, he will
wander about by night and day in vain? This age is possessed of the
<i>opposite</i> instincts. What it wants, above all, is comfort; secondly,
it wants publicity and the deafening din of actors' voices, the big
drum which appeals to its Bank-Holiday tastes; thirdly, that every
one should lie on his belly in utter subjection before the greatest
of all lies&mdash;which is "the equality of men"&mdash;and should honour only
those virtues which <i>make men equal and place them in equal positions.</i>
But in this way, the rise of the philosopher, as I understand him, is
made completely impossible&mdash;despite the fact that many may regard the
present tendencies as rather favourable to his advent. As a matter of
fact, the whole world mourns, to-day, the hard times that philosophers
<i>used</i> to have, hemmed in between the fear of the stake, a guilty
conscience, and the presumptuous wisdom of the Fathers of the Church:
but the truth is, that precisely these conditions were <i>ever so much
more favourable</i> to the education of a mighty, extensive, subtle,
rash, and daring intellect than the conditions prevailing to-day. At
present another kind of intellect, the intellect of the demagogue, of
the actor, and perhaps of the beaver- and ant-like scholar too, finds
the best possible conditions for its development. But even <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>for artists
of a superior calibre the conditions are already far from favourable:
for does not every one of them, almost, perish owing to his want of
discipline? They are no longer tyrannised over by an outside power&mdash;by
the tables of absolute values enforced by a Church or by a
monarch: and thus they no longer learn to develop their "inner tyrant,"
their <i>will.</i> And what holds good of artists also holds good, to a
greater and more fatal degree, of philosophers. Where, then, are free
spirits to be found to-day? Let any one show me a free spirit to-day!</p>


<p class="parnum">465.</p>

<p>Under "Spiritual freedom" I understand something very definite: it is
a state in which one is a hundred times superior to philosophers and
other disciples of "truth" in one's severity towards one's self, in
one's uprightness, in one's courage, and in one's absolute will to say
nay even when it is dangerous to say nay. I regard the philosophers
that have appeared heretofore as <i>contemptible libertines</i> hiding
behind the petticoats of the female "Truth."</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
